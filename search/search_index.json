It can be also used to determine which boards are up and running. The canLoader allows to either use plx canbus boards or esd canbus boards (actually any device implementing an ICanBus interface in YARP). Detailed CANLoader protocol . Steps \u00b6 Determine the type of device you want to use. If you are on the pc104 this will probably be the cfw2 device. Make sure you have compiled the appropriate canbus device (pcan,cfw2 or ecan) (read Compilation on the pc104). Make sure the canLoader program has been compiled. In the main iCub project, this is done automatically if you have the gtk/gtkmm libraries. Run the canLoader program. If you ssh into the pc104 make sure you use the -X option to redirect the graphic output to your local machine. Select the device you use (cfw2/pcan/ecan) in the text box (for historical reason default is ecan). Select the can network you want to probe (0 to 9), and hit connect. See below for a list of the can networks. You should see a list of boards that are available in the network you have selected, their id, the version of the firmware, the build number and a text description. If a card is listed here it means that it was able to reply to the broadcast message from the canLoader (a good start). Device Type \u00b6 The device type is the software module that wraps the can bus device you are using. On the first version of iCub the pc104 has a plx can bus device, wrapped by the pcan software module. On iCub 1.1 the pc104 also mounts two esd can bus devices, which are wrapped by the ecan software module. In this case the device module you use depends on - The can bus network (or body part) your want to access. On iCub 1.1.1 (and later) the pc104 mounts up to 9 can bus devices, which are wrapped by the cfw2 software module. Standard firmware update (DSP) \u00b6 The firmware upgrade of the whole robot is performed using a script based on a command line version of the CanLoader module. Before you try to use this script please check that this module is compiled on the pc104. You should also make sure that the hardware modules it needs (controlboard, canmotioncontrol, ecan/pcan/cfw2can) are compiled and liked correctly (this is usually the case on the robot pc104). Please notice that the firmware upgrade is delicate procedure which changes one of the core parts of the iCub robot software (and therefore requires a corresponding update of the yarp and iCub modules). If you decide to perform a firmware upgrade, be aware that this might change the robot motor behaviour quite a lot. Nevertheless, a firmware upgrade is always recommended because it usually corresponds to improvements in the control board performances. Finally, remember to perform the firmware update with your robot in a 'clean' state (i.e. control boards have been just turned on, and iCubinterface has not run yet). Here are the steps to perform the firmware update: Connect to the PC104. Go to the $ICUB_ROOT directory and update it (svn update or git pull, depending on your installation) Go to the $ICUB_DIR directoy and recompile the icub-main repository If the icub-firmware-build directory does not exists, create it with: git clone robotology/icub-firmware-build If it already exists, update it with git pull. Launch the firmware update script (icub-firmware-build/updateRobot.sh): The script will automatically retrieve the robot configuration from the firmwareUpdate.txt file which is located in the robot configuration folder. When the updateRobot.sh script terminates, a brief report about the firmware update operation is shown on the screen. If all the listed boards have the \"ALL OK\" tag, then the update was successful. If one or more boards show errors, you can use the CanLoader application in order to check what went wrong, and retry to download the firmware on that particular boards. The CanLoader GUI allows you to check if all the boards have the updated firmware: simply compare the Build number with the most recent build number reported by the ChangeLog file (icub-firmware/motorControllerDsp56f807/2BLL/ChangeLog for the type=RM BLL(DSP) boards and icub-firmware/motorControllerDsp56f807/4DC/ChangeLog for the type=RM 4DC(DSP) boards). Automatic update of the full robot with the FirmwareUpdater program will soon be possible. For some preliminary details see section (2) of document https://github.com/robotology/icub-firmware-build/blob/master/docs/FirmwareUpdater.readme.fulldetails.txt . Advanced firmware update (DSP) \u00b6 Alternatively to the complete firmware upgrade procedure described above, you can also create your own custom script which update just a part of the robot, for example: icub@pc104:ICUB_ROOT/firmware/build$ ./updateRobot.sh updateLegs.txt The .txt file simply contains a list of board addresses and associated firmware files with the following structure: [canModule] [canDeviceNum] [boardId] [firmware] where: canModule can be either pcan (if you are using the PLX custom board) or ecan (if you are using the commercial usb to can interface produced by ESD ) or cfw2can (if you are using the custom CFW2 board). canDeviceNum is the CAN line identifier (i.e: 0 for the head, 1 for the left arm, 2 for the right arm, etc..) boardID is the board address (0...14) on the selected CAN line. firmware is the firmware binary file (*.s for motorola-based boards, *.hex for DSPIC-based board) Firmware update (Force/Torque Sensors) \u00b6 In this section is described the procedure to update the firmware of the F/T sensors . iCub (version >=1.1) is equipped with four F/T sensors , one for each limb, connected to the CanBus. For a complete reference of the used CAN bus addresses please refer to: list of the CAN bus addresses Procedure for updating the firmware of the F/T Sensors \u00b6 The update of the F/T sensors firmware is performed using the CanLoader module. The procedure is identical to the standard procedure used to update the firmware of a single DSP board: open the CanLoader GUI. select the can bus number and the can bus device driver from the menus and click 'Connect'. select the F/T sensor (click on the checkbox on the left). select the firmware file from the file selector on the right (default location: iCub\\src\\firmware\\build\\strain.hex). click 'Start Download'. Note: A command-line procedure is also provided. To update the firmware, run the following command: canLoader20 --canDeviceType --canDeviceNum --boardId --firmware where: parameter is the name of the CAN bus driver. It can be ecan or pcan or cfw2can parameter is the number of the CAN bus (0-9) parameter is the CAN address of the F/T sensor (0-15) parameter is the firmware binary file (e.g. strain.hex) Reset of the F/T Sensors \u00b6 Note: This procedure completely erases both the flash and the eeprom of the F/T Sensor. You will have to download again the calibration data in the sensor after performing the reset of the F/T sensor. It's most likely that you DO NOT have to follow this procedure, unless some serious problem occurred. Even if you downloaded a wrong firmware file in the F/T sensors, only the standard procedure described above is needed to update it. The procedure to reset a F/T Sensor is the following: open the CanLoader GUI. select the can bus number and the can bus device driver from the menus and click 'Connect'. select the F/T sensor (click on the checkbox on the left). check the eeprom box on the right. select the firmware file from the file selector on the right (default location: iCub\\src\\firmware\\build\\strain.hex). click 'Start Download'. After the completion of the firmware download: reboot the F/T sensor (remove the power supply, restart the sensor, reconnect the Can Loader GUI, waiting for the boot time (10 seconds). after the reset, the CAN address of the sensor will be changed to 15. Change it by clicking on the number in the Can Loader GUI. The new address is automatically saved in the sensor eeprom. download a the correspoding sensor calibration data. Note: Remember: do not erase the F/T sensor eeprom, unless you are really sure what you are going to do or you were instructed to do so. Import of the calibration data \u00b6 This procedure is used to download the calibration data in the F/T sensors eeprom. Since iCub mounts calibrated F/T sensors, you don't need to follow this procedure, unless you intentionally erased the sensor eeprom. (even if you flash a new firmware update, you do not need to redownload the calibration data because they are kept in eeprom memory) The procedure to import the calibration data is identical to the standard firmware update, just select a calibration file (calibrationDataSN*.dat) instead of a firmware file (strain.hex). open the CanLoader GUI. select the can bus number and the can bus device driver from the menus and click 'Connect'. select the F/T sensor (click on the checkbox on the left). select the calibration file from the file selector on the right (default location: iCub\\app\\ \\conf\\calibration\\ftSensor\\ \\calibrationDataSN*.dat). click 'Start Download'. The software automatically distinguish a calibration data file from a firmware binary file. The calibration data are automatically saved in the eeprom. Note: A command-line procedure is also provided. To update the firmware, run the following command: canLoader20 --canDeviceType <t> --canDeviceNum <x> --boardId <y> --calibration <f> where: parameter is the name of the CAN bus driver.

The real cause of the issue is actually explained in the v1.25 release notes : The peripheral libraries are no longer shipped with the compiler package. These may be downloaded separately from the MPLAB XC download page. So, the proper fix is to download the additional Legacy Peripheral Libraries as explained int the previous section. Running the MPLAB X IDE [WIP] \u00b6 Run app MPLAB X IDE v5.40. Open the project 2FOC-V3.X (shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+O on windows). You should see in the lower left pane: The 2FOC device is the dsPIC33FJ128MC802 . Then, click on Packs - dsPIC33F-GP You should see a popup window with the project properties: Just click \"OK\".

For each sub-system, the programmer will be able to retrieve the control interfaces they need. We expect that these control interfaces will normally be accessed remotely, for all but the tightest control loops. There will be three ports per control group. For example, the head group will have three ports named as follows: port name purpose /icub/head/rpc:i commands that require replies /icub/head/command:i streaming commands /icub/head/state:o motor state information A user can see the commands that the rpc:i port supports by using yarp rpc to send it the message help , or browsing to it via the address reported by yarp where and clicking help . For example, typing: yarp rpc /icub/head/rpc:i followed by: [set] [pos] 0 45 will command axis 0 of the head (neck_pitch) to 45 degrees. If no motion is seen, it may be necessary to enable the axis: [set] [aen] 0 where aen means axis enable . The braces are optional. Of course, there are APIs for all such operations.

For simplicity we decide to ignore for the time being this difference, that is relevant for multi-DOF joints and closed kinematic structures. The joints are mechanism that connect two different links (as defined in the following section) of the robot. 1-DOF joints allow motion only along one direction between the two connected links.

Each link is characterised by a mass (represented in models by the inertial parameters) and a physical shape (represented in models by meshes). For defining the links we are representing the robot as a directed tree, where the root_link is the body that can be attached to the pole, and the meaning of the other links can be deduced by their parent joint, as defined in the previous section. The main idea behind this naming scheme is that \u201cbig\u201d links (roughly speaking, the one that can reasonably interact with the user) are named with intuitive names such as upper_arm , forearm , upper_leg , lower_leg , chest , head , foot , hand . All the little links that instead are part of more complex linkages, take their name from the articulation, such as torso_1 , torso_2 .

To identify the axes' directions, however, a particular robot joint configuration must be set, since the positions of these axes depend upon the joint angles. To this purpose, we assume joint angles equal to zero (i.e. legs and arms straight down), implicitly assuming that the fine calibration has been carried on so that these zeros are properly defined iCub Calibration . Then, in this configuration, the joint axis is expressed with respect to the iCub's root frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics . One shall observe that the arm joint axes with joint angles equal to zero do not coincide perfectly with any of the root frame axes. Yet, the directions listed below help the user understand the arm axis directions. The range of motion can be extracted from the configuration files of the iCubGenovaXX robot. P.S. The parenthesis around some of the numbers in the table below are only for formatting concerns, and should be ignored.

However this link frame definition is dependent on the formalism that one uses for describing the robot. For example, if the Denavit Hartenberg convention is used the link frame origin is required to be placed on the axis of the child joint, while if the Modified Denavit Hartenberg convention or the URDF format the link frame origin is required to be place on the axis of the parent joint. To avoid inconsistency, we clearly separate frame and link concepts. iKin Frames \u00b6 For the iCub, it could be useful to explicitly state the frame used for defining the kinematic chains used in the iKin library. In particular a useful set of frames could be: Frame Name Link Explanation root_frame root_link Root reference frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics imu_frame head Inertial sensor (XSens MTx) reference frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics l_hand_dh_frame l_hand Left hand frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics r_hand_dh_frame r_hand Right hand frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics l_foot_dh_frame l_foot Left foot frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics r_foot_dh_frame r_foot Right foot frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics l_eye_frame \u2014 (missing at the moment) Left eye frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics r_eye_frame \u2014 (missing at the moment) Right eye frame, as defined in ICubForwardKinematics l_arm_ft_frame l_upper_arm,l_arm Left Arm FT sensor frame, as defined in FT_sesors r_arm_ft_frame r_upper_arm,r_arm Right Arm FT sensor frame, as defined in FT_sesors l_leg_ft_frame l_hip_2,l_hip_3 Left Leg FT sensor frame, as defined in FT_sesors l_foot_ft_frame l_upper_foot,l_foot Left Foot FT sensor frame, as defined in FT_sesors r_leg_ft_frame r_hip_2,r_hip_3 Right Leg FT sensor frame, as defined in FT_sesors r_foot_ft_frame r_upper_foot,r_foot Right Foot FT sensor frame, as defined in FT_sesors Skin Frames \u00b6 An interesting set of frame is the frame defined by the iKin convention ( ICubForwardKinematics ). This reference frames are used by the skin system to express contact points, force and torques (in skinDynLib data structures) and taxel positions. The one currently used by the skin system are: Frame Name Link Explanation l_foot_dh_frame l_foot Frame of LEFT_FOOT SkinPart r_foot_dh_frame r_foot Frame of RIGHT_FOOT SkinPart l_upper_arm_dh_frame l_upper_arm Frame of SKIN_LEFT_UPPER_ARM SkinPart l_forearm_dh_frame l_forearm Frame of SKIN_LEFT_FOREARM SkinPart l_hand_dh_frame l_hand Frame of SKIN_LEFT_HAND SkinPart r_upper_arm_dh_frame r_upper_arm Frame of SKIN_RIGHT_UPPER_ARM SkinPart r_forearm_dh_frame r_forearm Frame of SKIN_RIGHT_FOREARM SkinPart r_hand_dh_frame r_hand Frame of SKIN_RIGHT_HAND SkinPart URDF frames \u00b6 Some frames are defined to be compatible with certain convention used for URDF files, for example http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0120.html .

To this purpose, we assume joint angles equal to zero (i.e. legs and arms straight down), implicitly assuming that the fine calibration has been carried on so that these zeros are properly defined iCub Calibration .

It can be useful both who approaches robot configuration for the first time and for expert user: the first finds here explanation of the structure of configuration data set and which are the parameter he/she can change, while the second find rules how to filling configuration files of a new robot. Introduction \u00b6 Yarprobotinterface application starts all devices and modules required by a robot to work properly. Any device needs a configuration data set that could differs from robot to robot, so each robot has own configuration, saved in xml files contained in a folder called with robot's name in the repository robots-configuration . Each robot has a main configuration file, usually named icub_all.xml, that contains the list of all devices and other modules, like Calibrators and Cartesian, that Yarprobotinterface starts. (Note: here \"device\" means DeviceDriver of Yarp. The reader is supposed to have knowledge about a driver and a wrapper of yarp. If not, please see YARP documentation .) Structure of robot configuration data set \u00b6 The data set contains configuration for software modules, robot hardware and wrappers. The hardware configuration structure depends on the mechanical-electronic architecture of the robot heavily. Each device represents a sensor or a motor controller of group of joints. A device refers to an ethernet board mounted on the robot, but an ethernet board can be referred to by more devices: for example if a board controls 4 motors and reads the FT sensor, then both the motor control device and FT device have a reference to the board in question. Each robot configuration folder has following structure: RobotNameFolder: Calibrators: each robot body part has a calibration file bodyPart_calib.xml with calibration data, that are robot dependent. Camera: configuration about cameras mounted on robot Cartesian: configuration about the cartesian module Hardware: here there are descriptions of all devices available on robot Mais: description of analog mais devices FT: description of Force-Torque devices Inertials : description of inertials devices Skin: description of skin devices Motorcontrol: description of motor control devices Electronics: description of embedded Ethernet boards mounted on robot. Mechanicals: description of mechanical features involved in motion control Wrappers: configuration of yarp wrappers of devices Some .ini files. Among .ini files, there is yarprobotinterface.ini that specifies which is the file containing list of devices to start, usually its name is icub_all.xml . general.xml : contains some flags that change behavior of Yarprobotinterface . In the following snippet there is typical main configuration file: it shows the configuration of left arm only. If you desire to have look at the entire file, see icub_all.xml in a robot folder. IMPORTANT==> It is important to notice that names of each files follow specific rules. It is very important following the naming convention because the file name can give you some information about the device or wrapper. Please see the section Naming convention <!-- LEFT ARM --> <devices file= \"hardware/motorControl/left_arm-eb1-j0_3-mc.xml\" /> <!-- motion control device that controls joints numbered from 0 to 3 --> <devices file= \"hardware/motorControl/left_arm-eb24-j4_7-mc.xml\" /> <!-- motion control device that controls joints numbered from 4 to 7 --> <devices file= \"hardware/motorControl/left_arm-eb25-j8_11-mc.xml\" /> <!-- motion control device that controls joints numbered from 8 to 11 --> <devices file= \"hardware/motorControl/left_arm-eb26-j12_15-mc.xml\" /> <!-- motion control device that controls joints numbered from 12 to 15 --> <devices file= \"wrappers/motorControl/left_arm-mc_wrapper.xml\" /> <!-- wrapper of motion control devices --> <!-- LEFT ARM MAIS:device and its wrapper --> <devices file= \"hardware/MAIS/left_arm-eb26-j12_15-mais.xml\" /> <devices file= \"wrappers/MAIS/left_arm-mais_wrapper.xml\" /> <!-- LEFT ARM SKIN :device and its wrapper--> <devices file= \"hardware/skin/left_arm-eb24-j4_7-skin.xml\" /> <devices file= \"wrappers/skin/left_arm-skin_wrapper.xml\" /> <!-- LEFT ARM FT device and its wrapper --> <devices file= \"wrappers/FT/left_arm-FT_wrapper.xml\" /> <devices file= \"hardware/FT/left_arm-eb1-j0_3-strain.xml\" /> <!-- CALIBRATOR --> <devices file= \"calibrators/left_arm-calib.xml\" /> Naming convention \u00b6 To help maintenance of configuration files, it is necessary to include the following information in the names of each single file: robot body parts; type of device or type of information contained in the file, like mechanicals or electronic or motor control data; the electronics board number: in case of configuration file of device, it is useful to know which is the electronic board to refer to. number of joints connected to the board. Rules for naming devices \u00b6 This is the pattern of name of each device and its configuration file: body_part-ebX-jA_B-type_of_device. In details, each name is make up of 4 parts: body_part: head, face, left_arm, right_arm, torso, left_leg, right_leg; ebX: where X is the number of electronic board written on schematics document. Usually, but not always, X is also the last number of board\u2019s ip address; jA_B: this indicates that the board ebX controls joints from A to B. This information let you know if board is in upper or lower part. type_of_device: skin, mais, strain, mc, intertials. For example, the configuration file of motor control device of joint 0 and 1 of head is named head-eb20-j0_1-mc.xml and inside it there is the name of device head-eb20-j0_1-mc: <devices robot= \"robotName\" build= \"1\" > <device name= \"head-eb20-j0_1-mc\" type= \"embObjMotionControl\" > <params ....... /> \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. </device> </devices> Rules for naming wrapper file \u00b6 The wrapper name and its configuration files should have the same name and its pattern is : body_part-type_of_device_wrapper.xml. In details, each file name is make up of 2 parts: body_part: head, face, left_arm, right_arm, torso, left_leg, right_leg, left_foot, right_foot; type_of_device_wrapper: skin_wrapper, mais_wrapper, FT_wrapper, VFT_wrapper, mc_wrapper. Rules for naming joints \u00b6 Each joint has a name that follows the naming convention explained here . Configuration of devices \u00b6 To configure a device it is necessary some specific data depending on device type and information of electronic board it refers to. So, more devices can refer to the same electronic board: for example a motion control device and a skin device could share the same electronic board, this mean that the board can controller some joints and can read skin values at the same time. In following sections, you can find an overview of configuration of each device type, while the meaning of each parameter is describes in respective template file in folder iCubTemplates/iCubTemplateVx_y in this repository . Currently the most recent version is iCubTemplateV5_0. Motor control device \u00b6 Configuration of a motor control device is composed by the wiring, mechanicals and obviously by motor control specification related to joints it manages. In Ethernet robots, a motor control device corresponds to a motor control electronic board that manages from one up to twelve joints. The entry point of motor control device configuration is the file named body_part-ebX-jA_B-mc.xml , that is included in icub_all.xml. This file contains all parameters that the robot's user can modify, for example PID and joints limits, and links other 4 files that only maintainers should modify. These other four files are: general.xml : contains some flags that change behavior of the device body_part-ebX-jA_B-eln.xml : contains description of electronic board , such as ip address, and specific parameters of communication protocol used by firmware and yarp devices. body_part-ebX-jA_B-mec.xml : contains specific information about mechanics. Usually this file should be equal for all robots of same version. body_part-ebX-jA_B-mc_service.xml : contains all the information necessary for the firmware to initialize the motion control service: it needs to know for each joint which is its pwm port, which is its encoder and where is connected. It is important to notice that each parameter inside mechanicals, motion-control and motion-control-service files needs to have the same number of values of number of joints to configure. One of the major changes started from version 3.0 and consists of introduction of CONTROLS tag: it allows the user to save in file different PID configurations and he/she can choose which configuration he/she wants to use depending on the experiment he/she wants to run on the robot. To do this, the user writes one or more sections of PID within the file and indicates the selected PID in the \"CONTROLS\" group. Below there is just a snippet of an example of a head movement control device configuration file: the example only refers to the configuration of the control PID in the position mode, but the same concept can be extended to other modalities. <group name= \"CONTROLS\" > <param name= \"positionControl\" > JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1 JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1 </param> <param name= \"velocityControl\" > none none </param> <param name= \"torqueControl\" > none none </param> <param name= \"currentPid\" > none none </param> </group> <group name= \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1\" > <param name= \"controlLaw\" > Pid_inPos_outPwm </param> <param name= \"controlUnits\" > metric_units </param> <param name= \"pos_kp\" > 1100.00 -1000 </param> <param name= \"pos_kd\" > 0.0 0.0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ki\" > 0.0 -100 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxOutput\" > 3360 3360 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxInt\" > 3360 3360 </param> <param name= \"pos_shift\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ko\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionUp\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionDwn\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_kff\" > 0 0 </param> </group> <group name= \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_2\" > <param name= \"controlLaw\" > Pid_inPos_outPwm </param> <param name= \"controlUnits\" > metric_units </param> <param name= \"pos_kp\" > 800.00 -600 </param> <param name= \"pos_kd\" > 0.0 0.0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ki\" > 0.0 -100 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxOutput\" > 1000 1000 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxInt\" > 500 500 </param> <param name= \"pos_shift\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ko\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionUp\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionDwn\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_kff\" > 0 0 </param> </group> In this configuration, the user has selected PID with tag \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1\". If he/she want use a different setup, he/she needs to set \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_2\" in \"CONTROL\" group instead of \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1\". Moreover, it is possible to select \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1\" for some joints and \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_2\" for the others, but the user should be sure that \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1\" and \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_2\" has the same value of controlLaw parameter. FT sensor device \u00b6 This device represents a Force-Torque sensor mounted on robot, so in its configuration there are information about its CAN address, to which Ethernet board it is connected, etc. See the template file for more details. Mais device \u00b6 This device represents a mais sensor mounted on robot, so in its configuration there are information about its CAN address, to which Ethernet board it is connected, etc. See the template file for more details. Skin device \u00b6 A skin device represents a part of skin of robot; usually the part corresponds to a body part of robot. To configure this device, its is necessary the list of mtb boards that belong to this part and some data to configure each tactile point. Since almost all tactile points uses the same configuration values, there is a parameter called \u201cDefaultCfg\u201d, that is the default configuration, but there is also a \u201cSpecialCfg\u201d parameter by which the user can specified different configuration value for some tactile points. The configuration of this device is in two files: the entry point is body_part-ebX-skin.xml, where there are information about the location of mtb board and it includes body_part-ebX-skinSpec.xml, that contains tactile points configuration. Please, see template file for more details. Inertial device \u00b6 This device represents inertial sensors mounted on mtb boards connected to a Ethernet board. See template for more details. Configuration of calibrator module \u00b6 The calibrator module for Ethernet robots is parametricCalibratorEth; it uses the parameters written in body_part-calib.xml file. Please follow the link to get the meaning of each parameter. Here is reported a brief description of calibrator module and the role of some parameters are involved in calibration and parking procedures. The calibrator in the startup phase launches the calibration procedure: after a motor control devices has been configured, it tries to calibrate its joints. The calibration procedure is composed by three steps: Sets a safe pwm limit: uses value of parameter \u201cstartupMaxPwm\u201d, like the maximum pwm applicable to the motor; If the parameter \u201cskipCalibration\u201d in general.xml is false, it sends the calibrate command to each joint with the parameters written in the calibration file, else skips following steps leaving joints in not configured state and exits. If you are interested in details information about calibration and its parameter see here. (The link will be available asap, sorry for the incovenience). If the joint completes the calibration sucessfully, then it tries to move it to the \u201cstartupPosition\u201d using \u201cstartupVelocity\u201d specified in calibration file. If an error occurred in calibration phase, the joint is in fault error. If the \u201cstartupPosition\u201d is reached, then the joint is ready, else is in fault error. When the user shuts down Yarprobotinterface , the calibrator moves all joints to the park position, that is the position specified in \u201cpositionHome\u201d parameter using \u201cvelocityHome\u201d. Note for robots in iCub Tech (IIT Genoa, Italy) \u00b6 Usually the robots in iCub Facility run developing software, that is, they use the same software modules, but on the development branch instead of the stable one (master). For these robots, the most recent configuration is available on development branch of robots configuration repository in the folder iCubTemplates/iCubTemplateV5_0 . This mean that in the newest version may be available new parameters or there are some changes that are not described in the last stable version. If you are interesting in the meaning of this changes, please check iCubTemplates/iCubTemplateV5_0 .","title":"Robot Configuration"},{"location":"icub_kinematics/icub-robot-configuration/icub-robot-configuration/#robot-configuration","text":"The aim of this page is to explain the configuration of a Ethernet based robot and how it is structured in various files.

In Ethernet robots, a motor control device corresponds to a motor control electronic board that manages from one up to twelve joints. The entry point of motor control device configuration is the file named body_part-ebX-jA_B-mc.xml , that is included in icub_all.xml. This file contains all parameters that the robot's user can modify, for example PID and joints limits, and links other 4 files that only maintainers should modify. These other four files are: general.xml : contains some flags that change behavior of the device body_part-ebX-jA_B-eln.xml : contains description of electronic board , such as ip address, and specific parameters of communication protocol used by firmware and yarp devices. body_part-ebX-jA_B-mec.xml : contains specific information about mechanics. Usually this file should be equal for all robots of same version. body_part-ebX-jA_B-mc_service.xml : contains all the information necessary for the firmware to initialize the motion control service: it needs to know for each joint which is its pwm port, which is its encoder and where is connected. It is important to notice that each parameter inside mechanicals, motion-control and motion-control-service files needs to have the same number of values of number of joints to configure. One of the major changes started from version 3.0 and consists of introduction of CONTROLS tag: it allows the user to save in file different PID configurations and he/she can choose which configuration he/she wants to use depending on the experiment he/she wants to run on the robot. To do this, the user writes one or more sections of PID within the file and indicates the selected PID in the \"CONTROLS\" group. Below there is just a snippet of an example of a head movement control device configuration file: the example only refers to the configuration of the control PID in the position mode, but the same concept can be extended to other modalities. <group name= \"CONTROLS\" > <param name= \"positionControl\" > JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1 JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1 </param> <param name= \"velocityControl\" > none none </param> <param name= \"torqueControl\" > none none </param> <param name= \"currentPid\" > none none </param> </group> <group name= \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1\" > <param name= \"controlLaw\" > Pid_inPos_outPwm </param> <param name= \"controlUnits\" > metric_units </param> <param name= \"pos_kp\" > 1100.00 -1000 </param> <param name= \"pos_kd\" > 0.0 0.0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ki\" > 0.0 -100 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxOutput\" > 3360 3360 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxInt\" > 3360 3360 </param> <param name= \"pos_shift\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ko\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionUp\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionDwn\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_kff\" > 0 0 </param> </group> <group name= \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_2\" > <param name= \"controlLaw\" > Pid_inPos_outPwm </param> <param name= \"controlUnits\" > metric_units </param> <param name= \"pos_kp\" > 800.00 -600 </param> <param name= \"pos_kd\" > 0.0 0.0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ki\" > 0.0 -100 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxOutput\" > 1000 1000 </param> <param name= \"pos_maxInt\" > 500 500 </param> <param name= \"pos_shift\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_ko\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionUp\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_stictionDwn\" > 0 0 </param> <param name= \"pos_kff\" > 0 0 </param> </group> In this configuration, the user has selected PID with tag \"JOINT_PID_EXPERIM_1\".

Here is reported a brief description of calibrator module and the role of some parameters are involved in calibration and parking procedures. The calibrator in the startup phase launches the calibration procedure: after a motor control devices has been configured, it tries to calibrate its joints. The calibration procedure is composed by three steps: Sets a safe pwm limit: uses value of parameter \u201cstartupMaxPwm\u201d, like the maximum pwm applicable to the motor; If the parameter \u201cskipCalibration\u201d in general.xml is false, it sends the calibrate command to each joint with the parameters written in the calibration file, else skips following steps leaving joints in not configured state and exits. If you are interested in details information about calibration and its parameter see here. (The link will be available asap, sorry for the incovenience). If the joint completes the calibration sucessfully, then it tries to move it to the \u201cstartupPosition\u201d using \u201cstartupVelocity\u201d specified in calibration file. If an error occurred in calibration phase, the joint is in fault error. If the \u201cstartupPosition\u201d is reached, then the joint is ready, else is in fault error.

Recording and Playback \u00b6 Recording and playback is supported in yarp via libportaudio , which wraps on the top of the linux device drivers. These yarp devices are portaudioPlayer ( http://www.yarp.it/git-master/classPortAudioPlayerDeviceDriver.html ) and portaudioRecorder ( http://www.yarp.it/git-master/classPortAudioRecorderDeviceDriver.html ), we need to enable them from ccmake when we compile yarp on the laptop (the option is avilable only if libportaudio needs to be installed).

The parameters required by portaudioRecorder/portaudioPlayer are specific to the sound format (e.g. frequency, sample format etc). The parameters required by AudioRecorderWrapper/AudioPlayerWrapper define the fragmentation of the sound packets over the network and the buffering options. We recommend using the default options.

External network configurations \u00b6 Usually it is a static configuration, but it works also in DHCP mode. This configuration can be changed but it is not recommended IP address : 10.0.0.2 Netmask : 255.255.255.0 Default Gateway : 10.0.0.1 DNS server : 10.0.0.1 Networking implementation in iCubOS \u00b6 Basic principles \u00b6 The basic idea is that to setup a network bonding in active-passive mode with network and wifi connections, and the network has the role of master connection. So, if the network cable is connected to the robot, the traffic to icub-head passes through the cabled connection otherwise the system uses the wifi, but the connection keeps the same IP address. The switch is generally quite fast (couple of seconds), so we don't lose ssh connections to icub-head Netplan \u00b6 Latest ubuntu uses NETPLAN to configure the network via command line, so I setup netplan to create the above network bonding: netplan uses the configuration files it founds in the path /etc/netplan/ on startup, netplan load all files in the above path with the .yaml extension this behavior can be used to create several different configurations to choose from. In icub-head we have many files in the /etc/netplan path 50-icub-static.yaml.notload - a configuration file that uses STATIC IP for cabled network configuration ( no bonding, no wifi ) 50-icub-dhcp.yaml.notload - a configuration file that get IP for cabled network configuration from DHCP server ( no bonding, no wifi ) 50-icub-bonding-static.yaml.notload - a configuration that creates a bonding with cabled network and WiFi and uses a static IP for the bonded connection ( THIS IS THE DEFAULT ) 50-icub-bonding-dhcp.yaml.notload - a configuration that creates a bonding with cabled network and WiFi and gets the IP for the bonded connection from DHCP server 50-icub.yaml - a symbolic link that points to the active configuration Required configuration \u00b6 There are some parameters that must be configured on each icub-head installation because they are hardware dependant (network interfaces names) or user-dependant (Wifi configuration) Network interfaces names \u00b6 The names assigned to the network interfaces by the OS are hardware dependant, so on each new installation you must check that the name of the interfaces (internal, motor and wifi) written in the file /etc/netplan\\50-icub.yaml corresponds to the actual ones, shown by the commmand ip link WiFi \u00b6 If wifi is used (see above), please change the Wifi configuration in the file /etc/netplan\\50-icub.yaml with youR ESSID and WiFi password in the lines below wifis: ... access-points: \"please-put-your-ESSID-here\": password: \"please-put-your-wifi-password-here\"","title":"Networking"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/icubos/networking/#icub-networking","text":"The networking on icub can be divided in two parts: internal (motor) networking : it is a network that connects to icub-head and all the motor controller boards on the robot, it is a segregated network (there is no connection from the nodes on its subnet and the ouside world) and it is used to send motor commands from icub-head to motor control boards extenal networking : it is the network connection that connects icub-head to the robot private subnet; it is used to connect the robot to the other machines in its enviroments, to the icub-server and to internet; this connection cam wired or wireless It isa also available a bluetooth connection on the icub-head, but it currently used only to read data from the battery controller in the robot backpack.","title":"iCub networking"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/icubos/networking/#the-icub-private-subnet","text":"The icub private subnet is the subnnet that connects all the machines in the robot enmviroment, see the schema below","title":"The iCub private subnet"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/icubos/networking/#icub-head-network-interfaces","text":"On recent icub-head hardware there are 4 network interfaces: external cabled network - used to connect the icub-head to other machines in its enviroment, wired internal motor network - used to connect the icub-head to the onboard motor controllers external wireless network - used to connect the icub-head to other machines in its enviroment, wireless bluetooth interface - used to connect the icub-head to the battery controller","title":"icub-head network interfaces"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/icubos/networking/#ip-addresses-and-other-network-configurations","text":"Below you can find the default network paramenters of the the main icub-head network (external and motor).","title":"IP addresses and other network configurations"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/icubos/networking/#motor-network-configurations","text":"This configuration depends deeply from the motor control board firware and thus it can't be changed IP address : 10.0.1.104 - STATIC Netmask : 255.255.255.0 since this is a segregated network, there is no default gateway.","title":"Motor network configurations"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/icubos/networking/#external-network-configurations","text":"Usually it is a static configuration, but it works also in DHCP mode.

This is a basic setup, useful as a starting point to prepare any kind of machine of the iCub ecosystem. Operating System \u00b6 You can choose both a Debian or Ubuntu Linux, the currently suggested OS is Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) . User account \u00b6 Users and Passwords \u00b6 The default user account is Username : icub Password : icub If you want to change the default password simply execute ( this works only if you are using persistence ) passwd icub NOTE : As in any Ubuntu installation, the root user has no password, this means that the direct login (i.e. ssh root@icub-head ) is disabled, but you can always do sudo su - Creation of the icub user \u00b6 You need to create the icub user. For nfs (see later) to work this user has to have the uid 1000 and guid 1000. In LINUX starting procedure, is asks to create the first user. By default uid is set at 1000. To make sure it is done do : id -u icub id -g icub Add the icub user to the sudoers group, as follows sudo usermod -aG sudo icub Required and useful Packages \u00b6 Please install the following packages (names are correct for Ubuntu 18.04, please check the corresponding package in your distribution): nfs-common python-tk libopencv-dev ntpdate ssh cmake-curses-gui Also install (optional, but very useful) the following packages: vim iperf Debian Software repository \u00b6 NOTE : this step is required only for a Debian machine. Enable the non-free and contrib sources, by editing the file /etc/apt/sources.list iCub software repository and common packages \u00b6 NOTE : skip this step in case of icub server Configure the iCub software repository, by creating the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/icub.list as following example for a Debian 10 (Buster) machine : deb http://www.icub.org/debian buster contrib/science for a Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) machine : deb http://www.icub.org/ubuntu focal contrib/science Download the packages signature sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 57A5ACB6110576A6 After adding a new source, remember to update the packages list: apt-get update Install the following packages from icub repository icub-common Network configuration \u00b6 You have two options: Static IP address (this option is mandatory if there is no DHCP in your subnet - like in the case of the iCub server laptop - or if your machine is the DHCP server - this is the case of the \"real\" iCub server ) Dynamic DHCP IP address Configuration methods \u00b6 Usually, if you have a Desktop installed on your machine it's better to use the default desktop network tool (eg. in Ubuntu 20.04 the tool is Network Manager ). Otherwise, you can configure the network interfaces usign the commmand line configuration files (eg. in Ubuntu 20.40 you have to deal with NETPLAN ) the HOSTS file \u00b6 Please check that the file /etc/hosts looks asfollows: 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 MACHINE_HOSTNAME.icub.local MACHINE_HOSTNAME where MACHINE_HOSTNAME is the hostname of you machine, that should match the file /etc/hostname Mount remote NFS shares \u00b6 NOTE : skip this step in case of iCub server LAPTOP or iCub server To mount the remote NFS shares, edit /etc/fstab , by adding the folowing lines NFS_SERVER_IP:/exports/code /usr/local/src/robot nfs soft,retry=1,timeo=60,_netdev,auto 0 0 NFS_SERVER_IP:/exports/local_yarp /home/icub/.local/share/yarp nfs soft,retry=1,timeo=60,_netdev,auto 0 0 and replace NFS_SERVER_IP with the appropriate value for your network. As example, in case of a machine in an environment with the icub server the above configuration will be 10.0.0.1:/exports/code /usr/local/src/robot nfs soft,retry=1,timeo=60,_netdev,auto 0 0 \\ 10.0.0.1:/exports/local_yarp /home/icub/.local/share/yarp nfs soft,retry=1,timeo=60,_netdev,auto 0 0 Then create the two above mountpoints as follows mkdir -p /home/icub/.local/share/yarp mkdir -p /usr/local/src/robot NTP configuration \u00b6 NOTE : skip this step in case of icub server (both \"real\" and \"laptop\" versions) Edit the file /etc/ntp.conf by adding the following line server NTP_SERVER_IP and replace NTP_SERVER_IP with the appropriate value for your network. As example, in case of a machine in an environment with the icub server the above configuration will be server 10.0.0.1 iCub user environment variables \u00b6 NOTE : skip this step in case of iCub server Please see this section iCub bashrc customization \u00b6 There are several customization you need to apply to the file .bashrc\\_iCub : The YARP_ROBOT_NAME - you must insert your robot name, in the following line and remove comment #export YARP_ROBOT_NAME= The build path - the folder name where you object are created by cmake, in the following line #export OBJ_SUBDIR=\"build\" Optional - Configure remote desktop \u00b6 If you want to setup a VNC remote desktop, execute from a graphical session the following command vino-preferences If you get this error The authentication mechanism requested can not be provided by the computer please launch the following command, from a shell terminal gsettings set org.gnome.Vino enabled true Optional - Disable the screen power off \u00b6 Using the gnome3 control panel, it is not possible to avoid the system has to be idle for the monitor to be turned off, the maximum time is \"1 hour\", \"never\" is not possible. From the command line execute the following commands gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-display-ac 0 gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-display-battery 0 gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0 Optional - install nVidia video drivers \u00b6 Check if you have nvidia hardware sudo ubuntu-drivers devices and check the command output. In case of nvidia hardare you should see somthing like the following example == /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0 == vendor : NVIDIA Corporation modalias : pci:v000010DEd00000DDAsv000017AAsd000021D1bc03sc00i00 model : GF106GLM [Quadro 2000M] driver : xserver-xorg-video-nouveau - distro free builtin driver : nvidia-304-updates - distro non-free driver : nvidia-304 - distro non-free driver : nvidia-331 - distro non-free recommended driver : nvidia-331-updates - distro non-free The above example is showing that there are several different nVidia driver versions available, you should chose the recommended one (the nvidia-331 in above example ) Install the appropriate nvidia driver, as follows (for the example above) sudo apt install nvidia-331 Reboot For further details, please read this guide Optional - Fix the the .local domains resolution problems \u00b6 NOTE : only on clients, NOT on icub server. Edit /etc/nsswitch replacing the following line hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4 with hosts: files dns Optional - how to fix ssh lag on connect \u00b6 In case of lag in SSH connections, disable DNS lookup on ssh server, edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config adding the following line UseDNS no Optional - how to fix the \\\"nobody:nobody\\\" NFS mount issue \u00b6 If the NFS mounts shows NOBODY as UID and GUID, this mean that the client and the server are not in the same domain, check the file /etc/idmap.conf Usually it is derived from the domain name mentioned in /etc/resolv.conf so both, server and client must match. Special computers \u00b6 In case of special machines (such as the cuda workstation or icub laptop) you must follow further steps in order to complete the installation: The iCub server The iCub server laptop The nVidia CUDA workstation","title":"Generic iCub enviroment machines (eg. laptop)"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/other-machines/generic-machine/#introduction","text":"This page contains instructions on how to prepare a machine to work in the iCub Subnet environment.

Which version do I need? \u00b6 This question is quite common whenever the number of versions and revisions start to become... more than one. The Debian image to use depends on the iCub version: - iCub up to version 1.1 must use a Etch and a Half distribution (image version 1.x). Persistent filesystem allows deep system configuration; if you are happy with the current configuration you can skip this update, while if you really need to change system configuration now you can by applying this update. - iCub from version 1.2 on can use the latest version: we kindly recommend you to keep Debian system updated to the last version (at the time of writing it means the 9.x @ November 2020). For persistent filesystem this configuration can be changed without re-burning a new image, you can just edit the configuration files of the network as you would normally do with Linux system. Warning \u00b6 When you install (or \" burn \") the new PC104 image, installation procedure will overwrite the data already present on the USB disk your are using, so all data will be deleted. Burn the Debian image version 7.x (latest) \u00b6 Starting from version 6.0 images come in a compressed archive file containing the USB image to write to an USB memory. Where to download the ZIP archive \u00b6 Compressed archives can be downloaded here How to create the bootable USB drive with the live image \u00b6 Download the latest image from the above link Extract the image Take an USB-2 drive at least of 16 GB size (please note that using an USB3 disk or a huge disk, eg. 32 GB, may not work depending on the version of your PC104) burn the image file (it has the .img extension), you can use the follwing tools: Windows \u00b6 Please use Win32 Disk Imager Linux (command line) \u00b6 Linux users can use the dd command to directly write an IMG file\u2019s contents to a removable media device. Insert the removable media and run the following command on Ubuntu: sudo dd if=/home/user/icub-live_7.10-201126_rt-amd64.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M Replace /home/user/icub-live_7.10-201126_rt-amd64.img with the correct name of USB image and /dev/sdX with the path to your USB or SD card device. Be very careful to specify the correct disk path here \u2014 if you specify the path to your system drive instead, you\u2019ll write the contents of the image to your operating system drive and corrupt it Linux (GUI tool) \u00b6 There is a GUI available in Ubuntu, called \"Disks\" (gnome-disks) and comes default in later Ubuntu: connect the USB drive and just right-click on the image file and select \"Open with Disk Image Writer\" , then select the drive USB drive you just inserted. See also this guide Burn the Debian image version 5.x (old) \u00b6 From version 5.0 on, the image is based on a Debian LIVE system. Version 5.x images come into a standard ISO Hybrid image file and there is a script to write the image to a USB memory Where to download the ISO image and burn script \u00b6 ISO images and the script can be downloaded here Some images are compressed, if so uncompress it before proceeding. To verify the file has been successfully downloaded, the md5 code can be verified by placing the .md5 file in the same folder as the uncompressed image and typing the following command: md5sum --check MD5FILE.md5 How to put the iso on a USB memory \u00b6 Please use the icub_iso2usb.sh script: this script will create a working bootable USB from the ISO file and ensure compatibility on some old PC104. This scripts will also enable file persistence (see below). NOTE : this script is compatible ONLY with Debian GNU/Linux 7 wheezy and Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS Trusty What is file persistence and how to use it \u00b6 File persistence is used to write the changes you made to the live filesystem (i.e. if you modify a file or write a new one) to a separate partition on the USB memory, allowing those changes to survive a reboot. The bigger is the USB memory, the more space you have for the new files, so we suggest at least a 4 Gb USB memory. If you mount an USB memory which persistence enable on a normal PC, you will see two partitions: LIVE partition, which contains the live image files PERSITENCE partition, which contains all the modified or new files How to use the icub_iso2usb.sh script \u00b6 This script takes a iCub PC104 live image and write it to an USB memory, optionally enabling file persistence. The script run on a Linux system and requires the following commands to be installed: parted mkdiskimage mkdosfs mkfs.ext4 install-mbr syslinux p7zip On a Debian 7 system, this means that you must install the following packages parted syslinux syslinux-common syslinux-utils dosfstools e2fsprogs p7zip mbr The script usage is the following icub_iso2usb.sh -f LIVE_ISO_FILE -t USB_TARGET_DEVICE [-p PERSISTENCE_SIZE] where: LIVE_ISO_FILE is the live filename (mandatory parameter) USB_TARGET_DEVICE is the device to write to the iso image - important: USE a device not a partition (mandatory parameter) PERSISTENCE_SIZE is the size of overlay partition (in MB) - set to 0 to disable overlay, the default persistence size is 1024 MB Example: icub_iso2usb.sh -f icub-live_4.0-14.11.12-rt-amd64.iso -t sdc There is also an inline help for the script, available with icub_icub2usb.sh -h The image requires an amount of space which is bigger than the the ISO size of a 10%, so setup the persistence partition size accordingly. The script checks if the target USB memory has enough space for live system and persistence (if not disabled), so don't worry. Required customizations \u00b6 Set RobotName variable \u00b6 Edit the file: /home/icub/.bashrc_iCub replace the line: export YARP_ROBOT_NAME=myiCubRobotName00 with the name of your robot e.g. iCubGenova01 clean the CMakeCache before compiling \u00b6 When upgrading the usb key to a different version, remember to clean the CMakeCache before compiling!! This is because some path are likely to be changed in the meanwhile SSH passwordless login \u00b6 User authentication credentials are stored inside the /home/icub/.ssh/authorized_key file; each line in this file is related to a different entry user@host. User credentials can be added also by using this command for each user@machine you want to log from : ssh-copy-id -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub icub@pc104 Startup scripts \u00b6 Important : these instructions apply to the recent persistent images of the Linux (starting from 1.7 and 3.0). There are some scripts that customize the Linux when the pc104 boots up; those scripts are inside /etc/rciCub.d folder. Normally, you don\\'t need to modify them, but be aware of them. Other Customizations \u00b6 The persistent version of the Debian distribution is now writable so any customization can be done. Please be aware of what you do, because any changes in configuration file can lead to malfunction. Common Problems and how to solve them \u00b6 I used an USB3 and/or 32 GB disk and the system does not boot \u00b6 Try with a USB2 smaller ( 16GB or better 8 GB) drive. Some PC104 have problems in reading those recent USB drives. The icub_iso2usb.sh script asks me \"The closest location we can manage is.. Is this still acceptable to you?\" \u00b6 Simply press \"Y\" and forget about the warning \"Information: You may need to update /etc/fstab.\" :) Once I created a new USB memory with the PC104 image, ssh complains that \"Remote host identification has changed\" and does not connect to the PC104 \u00b6 This is normal: for security reasons when a new iCub live is executed for the first time, a new SSH Key is created for the PC104 host. Please remove all the entries in the file ~/.ssh/known_hosts that refers to pc104 or 10.0.0.2 and login again. This must be done from each machine you want to connect to the PC104. See also this link I used the live USB first on a computer, then when I plugged it into the PC104 it does not work anymore \u00b6 Probably the PC104 booted correctly, but the network is not reachable (you can check it by connecting a vga cable to the PC104 inside iCub's head) Live systems write some info about the network card the first time they boot on a machine. This implies that if you boot the live on a desktop and then you plug it to a different machine the network may not work (since the network card is different). To fix this you have two options: quick and dirty - on the live USB, open the file /etc/udev/rules.d/70-presisten-net.rules and remove any pair of lines like the following: # PCI device 0x8086:0x10f5 (e1000e) SUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"00:1f:16:0b:47:4d\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth0\" (of course attributes like address , name or device may not exactly the same in your file) clean and easy - burn another USB and FIRST install it on the PC104 Detailed information \u00b6 If you want to get detailed information about the iCub LIVE image (i.e. the differences from a standard Debian LIVE) please read this page","title":"Installation"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/pc104/the-icub-live-installation/#introduction","text":"Here you can find the instruction on how to create a new USB memory stick with the lastest version of the OS running on the PC104.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"icub_operating_systems/pc104/the-icub-live-installation/#which-version-do-i-need","text":"This question is quite common whenever the number of versions and revisions start to become... more than one.

The type of calibration depends on the encoders and on the mechanics of the joints. There exist currently 12 types of calibrations that will be explained in detail in the following sections. The calibration procedure is performed by the firmware each time the robot starts up and it makes use of the following calibration parameters written in calibration files: Calibration type : it is the type of calibration. Its values should be included in [1,12]. Based on its value the meaning of the parameters calibration1 , calibration2 , calibration3 , calibration4 , calibration5 changes. Usually they are expressed in machine units. calibrationZero : for historical reasons, is the value in degree at 0.0 position . Now for several calibrations it is not necessary, so its value is 0.0 . calibrationDelta : this parameter can be changed by user to tuning the calibration, in order to set the zero of joint in the correct position (fine calibration). It is important to notice that the firmware does not deal with either calibrationZero or calibrationDelta parameters independently, but it has only the sum of the two: calibrationZero + calibrationDelta . For this reason, if the calibration needs a particular value of calibrationZero , please insert that value, because it is mandatory. General procedure for retrieving calibration parameters \u00b6 First off, you need to make sure that the boards have been reset after last calibration. If not, please swich off and swich on the boards. In the general.xml file set both useRawEncoderValue and skipCalibration parameters to true Press the fault button, so that you are sure that the procedure runs safely. Launch yarprobotinterface . You will see that yarprobotInterface tells you to press fault button and wait until the user presses enter. Start the calibration procedure depending on the calibration type. General rules for each calibration type \u00b6 At the end of calibration, the joint has to be inside of user limits, if not the controller sets the joint in hardware fault. If during calibration something goes wrong, then the controller sets the joint in hardware fault or leaves the joint in not configured state. The available calibrations in details \u00b6 Here are described the usage of the various calibration types; the param are in the calibrators files where you'll find a file for each part of the robot and looks like : <group name= \"CALIBRATION\" > <param name= \"calibrationType\" > 12 12 12 12 5 5 </param> <param name= \"calibration1\" > 30600 31535 46239 6687 3000 3000 </param> <param name= \"calibration2\" > 0 0 0 0 8192 8192 </param> <param name= \"calibration3\" > 0 0 0 0 0 0 </param> <param name= \"calibration4\" > 0 0 0 0 0 0 </param> <param name= \"calibration5\" > 0 0 0 0 0 0 </param> <param name= \"calibrationZero\" > 0 0 0 0 0 0 </param> <param name= \"calibrationDelta\" > 0 0 0 0 0 0 </param> <param name= \"startupPosition\" > 0 0 0 0 0 0 </param> <param name= \"startupVelocity\" > 10 10 20 20 20 20 </param> <param name= \"startupMaxPwm\" > 3000 3000 3000 3000 0 0 </param> <param name= \"startupPosThreshold\" > 90 90 2 2 2 2 </param> </group> Calibration 5 \u00b6 This calibration is used on joints with incremental encoder that needs to reach a hardware stop to take the reference position. Calibration type 5 calibration1 the pwm used to reach the hardstop calibration2 raw position at hardstop calibration3 not used calibration4 not used calibration5 not used calibrationZero 0.0 (only correct value) calibrationDelta defined by user expressed in degree Note The hardstop could be out of range of user limits, but it needs to be inside hardware limits; so the hardstop could be a hardware limit and the joint is calibrated after reaching it, but the controller verifies that the first received setpoint is inside user limits, else limits it to the nearest user limit. Calibration 6 \u00b6 This calibration is used for joint with MAIS board encoders. On iCub robots, distal and proximal joints use this encoder. Calibration type 6 calibration1 not used calibration2 velocity expressed in iCubDegree/s calibration3 1 if distal joint, -1 if proximal joint. (Any other value is not accepted) calibration4 mais raw value read with open hand calibration5 mais raw value read with closed hand calibrationZero 0.0 (only value corrected) calibrationDelta defined by user expressed in degree Info Calibration 6 uses mais raw values to calculate the joint encoder factor and the offset of 0.0 position. Moreover, it calibrates the motor encoder that is an incremental and for this joints needs to move: the target position depends on value of calibration3 parameter: if it is -1 then the joint move to the position written in calibration4 else to calibration5 . The movement is performed using the velocity specified in calibration2 parameter. Only if the joint can reach the target position then the calibration ends successfully. Calibration 7 \u00b6 This calibration is used for joint with absolute analog sensor. On iCub robot, this encoder is mounted on abduction fingers and on abduction thumb joints. Calibration type 7 calibration1 not used calibration2 not used calibration3 not used calibration4 sensor raw value read with open hand calibration5 sensor raw value read with closed hand calibrationZero 0.0 (only value corrected) calibrationDelta defined by user expressed in degree Info In order to guarantee the maximum possible resolution and to provide the simples calibration procedure to the user, this calibration calculates the joint encoder factors and the offset of 0.0 position, using the raw values. Calibration 8, 9 \u00b6 Calibration type 8 and type 9 are similar since they are used in R1 tripod joints, which are actuated by linear actuators with incremental encoders. They are both hard stop calibrations, but the difference is that type 8 calibration (wrist) makes use of limit switches readable by the MC4+ control board, while the torso tripod linear actuators ( type 9 ) have limit switches as well, but they aren't readable by the control board. So, when the motor stops during the calibration, it is assumed that the hard stop is reached. In both type 8 and type 9 hard stop calibration a counter reaction mechanism prevents some joints to move much farther than others in order to prevent damages to the structure. So a joint is slowed down if it is going faster than the others. If for some reason it insn't enough, the calibration fails. Calibration type 8 or 9 calibration1 pwm during calibration calibration2 maximum encoder difference treshold between two calibrating motors (safety mechanism described above) calibration3 not used calibration4 not used calibration5 not used calibrationZero 0.0 (only value corrected) calibrationDelta defined by user expressed in degree Calibration 12 \u00b6 This calibration is used for joint with absolute encoder, it is the newest version of calibration 3 and it simplifies the calibration procedure for the user; in fact the user needs only to write in calibration1 parameter the raw value read when jont is in 0.0 position and the firmware calculates the correct offset. Calibration type 12 calibration1 raw position at the zero position defined by user calibration2 not used calibration3 not used calibration4 not used calibration5 not used calibrationZero 0.0 (only value corrected) calibrationDelta defined by user expressed in degree Legend \u00b6 iCubDegree : the firmware uses iCubDegree instead of degree in order to use more resolution.

Arms Fine Calibration \u00b6 Here's described how to correct small errors in the calibration of the iCub. It applies mainly to the shoulder and elbow joints (joint0...joint3) but can be applied also for the other joints of the arm. Info This procedure has to be done after the calibration of the torso. Put the iCub in a suitable posture and let's call this configuration theta_desired in accordance to the convention you decided to use. As an example, if you decide to use the convention described in ICubForwardKinematics , you might decide to use the posture in the pictures which corresponds to theta_desired = [-90 15 15 90] [deg] (remember we are just considering the three dof of the shoulder and the elbow, an example is given in the pictures below). The aim is to insert the calibration deltas <param name=\"calibrationDelta\"> in each file using the formula: Delta = Theta - Theta_Desired . Eyes calibration \u00b6 The eyes mechanism has a total of three degrees of freedom. Both eyes can pan (independently) and tilt (simultaneously). Thus the three joints to calibrate are: version (left-right movement), vergence (in-out) and tilt (up-down). While the tilt can be calibrated by directly inserting the delta value in the calibration file, the version and vergence need to be calibrated as follows: Joint 4 (version): delta = |delta_j4| + |delta_j5| Joint 5 (vergence): delta = |delta_j4| - |delta_j5| with sign to be chosen accordingly. Cameras calibration \u00b6 Get GUID from camera \u00b6 Open a terminal on the icub-head and type : icub@icub-head:~$ yarpdev --device grabberDual --subdevice dragonfly2 --name /cam0 --d 0 --allow-deprecated-devices and you\u2019ll get the info below Now open a terminal on the server and type : icub@icubsrv:~$ yarpview --name /view0 icub@icubsrv:~$ yarp connect /cam0 /view0 Check which camera is working and then put the \u201cUnique ID\u201d in the respective files in $ROBOT_CODE/robots-configuration/ < $YARP_ROBOT_NAME>/camera Do all steps above again for the other camera, changing the --d 0 parameter to --d 1 in the first command. Calibrating cameras \u00b6 Now you need to ensure that the 2 cameras are perfectly aligned with each other. In order to do this, show a black cross to the robot at a specific distance (see pictures below) and adjust the cameras until reaching the correct alignment. Run yarprobotinterface and wait for robot calibration. Run yarpmanager , open Cameras entity then run the 2 yarpdev modules and connect. Open and run ONLY the 2 yarpview modules and connect. In a terminal on the server type: $ stereoCalib --from icubEyes.ini Warning DO NOT open the StereoCalibration app directly from yarpmanager otherwise you will not be able to see the result of the calibration process. Then type: $ yarp rpc /stereoCalibration/cmd hen type \u201cstart\u201d, a message \u201cStarting Calibration\u2026\u201d will appear. Now show the chess to the robot taking care to move it with a different inclination for each acquisition (30 in total). Stay still and just move the chessboard around. The chess needs to fit all the screen and be in landscape view. The system only acquire data if the colored lines appear over the chessboard. In the terminal of the stereoCalib you should see: xml Running Left Camera Calibration... RMS error reported by calibrateCamera: 0.592978 Running Right Camera Calibration...

Before starting the procedure print a chessboard calibration pattern. For convenience, you can find it in $ICUB_ROOT/app/cameraCalibration/data . Make sure you have a config file, e.g. cameraCalib.ini, with the following parameters: [STEREO_CALIBRATION_CONFIGURATION] boardWidth W boardHeight H boardSize S numberOfImages N MonoCalib value The boardWidth W is the number of corners along the width direction of the chessboard pattern (e.g. 8 for the provided pattern). The boardHeight H is the number of corners along the width direction of the chessboard pattern (e.g. 6 for the provided pattern). The boardSize S specifies the length (in meters) of one side of the squares in the chessboard pattern. The numberOfImages N specifies the number of images used for the calibration procedure (usually 20-30). The parameter value identifies if the module has to run the stereo calibration (Val=0) or the mono calibration (Val=1). For the mono calibration connect only the camera that you want to calibrate.

The two major modifications are on the Network side and Configuration side. Network Side \u00b6 The first conflict is that both the robots can be accessed by logging into the head using ssh icub-head with the same ip ( 10.0.0.2 ). So, while two robot have to be on the same network this has to be changed. The robots network configuration is set using netplan . Do ssh icub-head and go to /etc/netplan directory.

At this point you will not be able access icub-head any longer and you need to to ssh 10.0.0.200 to reach the head of the robot.

So, while trying to launch multiple robots on the same network, port address conflict happens.

An example can be found in dic-iit/robots-configuration/icub02-prefix were the iCubGenova02 configuration files have been updated in order to run icub_wbd.xml application with all the port prefixes changed to icub02 .

Left Forearm V1 Right Forearm V1 1 Basic Principles \u00b6 In the following document we describe how to connect the hand joints with the motors positioned in the forearm. The basic scheme is very simple and based on the following ideas: \u2212 Each motor rotates a pulley (P) \u2212 A (optionally coated) cable is twined around the pulley. The cable is fixed to the pulley by passing through a hole in the pulley (H). \u2212 The cable exits the motor by passing trough holes H1 and H2. \u2212 The cable enters into a tube (T1, T2, T3, T4) which guides its path trough the wrist. All the tubes are positioned on suitable sockets in correspondence of the holes (H1, H2). \u2212 Optionally the cable passes trough tensioners (Te1 and Te2) in between T1/T2 and T3/T4. Again the tensioners are provided with suitable sockets. \u2212 The cable exits the tube by entering into holes H3 and H4 once more equipped with suitable sockets for the tubes. Refer to the following example pictures: 1.1 General Rules to be Followed \u00b6 When mounting cables, pay attention to the fact that rotating the motor in a clockwise direction should correspond to a closure of the finger. The definition of clockwise rotation is given in the picture below. This rule is valid for all joints but distal joints; in the case of distal joints the closure of joints depends on some issues that will be discussed later on. 1.2 General Tips and Tricks \u00b6 \u2212 The uncoated cable is a bundle of smaller wires. When the cable is cut, this bundle may be corrupted (especially at the cable ending) by trying to pass the cable trough holes. A drop of glue on the cable ending may be useful. \u2212 Ideally the cable should be twined around the pulley P exactly at the middle of it. In particular, when the joint is in the middle of its range of movements the cable should leave the pulley P exactly at the level of the holes H1 and H2. If this is not the case, the friction of the cable at the level of H1 and H2 may break the cable after short usage. \u2212 Always check that the tubes are inside their sockets. If this is not the case cables will break easily due to high friction in correspondence of the input and output holes. \u2212 The tension of the cable is fundamental for having fingers working correctly. Always consider the possibility of using tensioners for increasing the cable tension. 2 WHAT DO I NEED TO CABLE \u00b6 Here you will find the overall table describing the the mandatory sheaths to be used in the correct place.

The motor rotates so as to move the slider (clockwise rotations correspond to moving the slider proximally, i.e. closer to the elbow). The slider pulls a couple of wires so as to close the ring and little finger. These 2 fingers are so actuated by 3 wires - 2 for the distal cables inside the fingers and 1 inside the motor shaft which moves the slider. The 2 cables needed for the R&P Distal Joint (from slider to fingers) are IITCODE 2391 and the 1 cable needed for the slider movements is IITCODE 1815 . The sheaths needed are: Dimension Label Notes 60(mm) 0-S or 0- Exits the motor case from the hole closer to the motor. Enters the hole in the slider near the hand (H5) 80(mm) 0+L Exits the motor case from the hole close to the ball bearing and arrives to the tensioner 73(mm) 0+S Exits from the tensioner and enters the hole in the slider near the elbow (H4) 112(mm) 2 Exits from the slider (H10) and enters the finger which is closer to the hole - ring. 112(mm) 9 Exits from the slider (H11) and enters the finger which is closer to the hole - pinkie. Tip Before connecting the sheath to the support insert and exit the cable, otherwise after this operation it would be more complicated. Here you can see the schematic of the cabling. The sheaths entering the fingers are represented in blue, while the sheaths for the slider movement are in red. The gray block is the tensioner. Please follow this link for an extended HOWTO route the cable. 4 HOW TO CABLE - WRIST \u00b6 The wrist movements (roll, pitch and yaw) are achieved with three motors located in the forearm. The wrist roll (or pronosupination) is achieved directly, i.e. without any cable driven joint. The wrist pitch and yaw are instead cable driven. The actuation is achieved with two motors which jointly collaborate to the pitch and yaw degrees of freedom. The actuation is differential with the following relationship: wrist_pitch = M1 wrist_yaw = M1 + M2 where M1 and M2 are the angular positions of the the two motors contributing to the movements. Wrist motors left arm Section view left arm The overall cables of the wrist are all build from IITCODE 1815 with the following specifications: IITCODE Alias/Provider Code Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. dia 0.63mm, not coated, AISI 316 4.1 Wrist Motor tendons \u00b6 From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the tendons inside the Right Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons.

WATCH OUT FOR the Left forearm : the motor positions are \"mirrored\" respect to the right ones. Pictures step by step guide In order to recable this joint, just insert the new cable IN side the hole (red circle - blue arrow) - the hole is in the internal side of the pulley cage. Once inserted, the cable should get OUT at the base of the phalange (red arrow). From the base of the phalange, insert the cable in the two pulleys following the path (red), ensuring that the cable remains parallel while looping (see bottom picture). For closing the cable, make it exit from the hole at the base of the nail and secure it in its socket with a knot 1-2cm away from the exit of the nail. By using a flat screwdriver the size of the throat, turning it the direction shown above (front view of the hand with palm down): you should be able to see the cable get sucked up until finally you can see the finger closing entirely.

After having removed the screws you should be able to move sideways the slider, being able more easily to fit the cable into the retaining socket, but mainly see both internal holes (blue circle for middle distal and red circle for index distal). Put the cable inside the correct hole, depending on which cable you are going to restore (middle finger - red hole & index finger - blue hole). Push it until it gets OUT from the base of the first phalange of either index or middle depending on the cable you want to fix. Twin the cable as shown and make a knot 1-2cm away from the exit of the nail.

Take one meter of cable IITCODE 1815 and start cabling along the pulley with cage already on: - 1 turn around the pulley for the motor side - 3 turns around pulley for the ball bearing side Make sure that the cables goes out of the pulley from both holes tangentially to the pulley. Insert the sheaths 0+S (ball bearing side) and 0-S (motor side). Assembly the motor passing the cable with 0-S sheath in the Ergal part - central hole, hand side (H5). Pass the cable with the 0+L sheath through the two motors under the slider, put a tensioner and the 0+S sheath and pass through the central hole of the Ergal part (cable should get out from H4), elbow side. At that moment the 2 sides of the cable get out, one from H4 and other side out of the Ergal part H5. Now pass the cables inside the slider superior and inferior holes: from H5 to H7 and from H4 to H6. Keeping straight the fingers with the piece of about 6 mm thickness inserted, tension the (0+S) cable and mark it with a pen, afterwards pull the slider backwards (the finger getting closed) and make a knot where there is the pen mark. Close the fingers (electrically) with the motor providing \u00b1 5.5 Volt and make the knot nearer than possible to the slider. 3 Proximal Joints \u00b6 3.1 Location \u00b6 Below you can see the back views of the forearms (palm down). The motor positions are mirrored. LEFT FOREARM RIGHT FOREARM real pic real pic If ever you realize that one of the following cable is broken bear in mind: Tip The start of the wiring for each proximal is identical (wiring around the motor pulley), the index and middle proximal joints are cabled exactly the same way, just the thumb is a bit trickier. 3.2 Cabling \u00b6 3.2.1 Preparation \u00b6 The minimum requirement to start recabling the proximal joints is: IITCODE Alias Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. dia 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 3.2.1 Cabling of the motor pulley & fingers \u00b6 Let' start with the cabling of the motor pulley. Pictures step by step guide Take 1 meter of IITCODE 1815 The following steps are common for the three fingers (index, middle, thumb). However, the holes for the thumb in the frame are slightly different (see next table). Turn the pulley in order to have the threads already facing (pointing toward) the holes inside the pink frame and the hole inside the pulley itself lying at horizontal. insert the cable inside the pulley and equitably half the cable on both side of the pulley. Respect the only one rule: 2 full turns around the pulley for the hole close to the ball bearing (blue cable) and 1 full turn for the part of the cable that will go into the hole the closest from the motor (red cable). Tip YOU may need to use the cable , glue it a the tip (2 cm long) on both side. With a plier make 2 times 90 degree angles on the cable at about 3-4 mm from one another. see picture to manage to extract the cable once it passes in between the thread and the neck of the frame. !!!PICTURE NEEDED!!!! Now we proceed with the cabling of the fingers. Pictures step by step guide After wrapping the cable on the pulley as shown before, insert the two cable extremities inside the frame holes for the Index & Middle. For the thumb, the frame holes are designed inclined by 45 deg, therefore the cables will not enter the frame perpendicularly as the previous case. Push the two sides of the cable inside the sheath (+) and (-) for each finger. The 2 sides of the cables should get out: For the Thumb: the cables exit from the base of the finger and enter inside two sheaths. For Index & Middle the cables exit at the base of their respective finger. Final cabling: For the Thumb, pass the cables around the pulley as shown. Start with the blue one. Fix the ends of the cables with a knot. Same procedure for the other fingers and make a knot at the end. FINISHED!!! Tip The final cabling is tricky. First, remember to CLOSE the tensioner of each cable before starting the cabling. If you leave the tensioners open, the cabling will not work. For making the final knot, put a mark on the blue cable and knot it. Slowly turn the motor CCW/CW while pulling the red extremity, ensuring that the cable is correctly running on the motor pulley. When the finger is completely closed pull the red cable and put a mark where the knot will be. Proceed by making the knot the closest to the mark. Finally, you can use the tensioners for removing the slack.","title":"Lower Arm V1"},{"location":"icub_tendons/lower_arm_V1/#howto-repair-any-cable-from-a-forearm-or-hand-version-1","text":"","title":"HOWTO REPAIR ANY CABLE FROM A FOREARM or HAND - VERSION 1"},{"location":"icub_tendons/lower_arm_V1/#1-overview","text":"Let's have an overview of the mechanical CAD from different view angles.

Just use a screwdriver to make the thumb start closing YOU ARE DONE!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!! Please close the fingertip and its nail and put back in place the lateral bar WATCH OUT FOR the Right forearm : the motor positions are \"mirrored\" respect to the Left ones. INDEX or MIDDLE: \u00b6 We will proceed by showing you how to re-cable both Index distal and Middle finger from the LEFT Forearm - Just be aware that the motors for the RIGHT Forearm are mirrored as per the WATCH OUT above explained. Pictures step by step guide 1. Insert the knot until it remains inside the socket of the pulley 2. Just insert the cable inside the hole (red circle) 3. The cable should get OUT from here - BE PATIENT!!! 4. The cable will then run inside the sheath until it reaches the base of the Middle or Index (view from the palm side) 5. Wire this way. 6. Please remove the screw holding the nail onto the fingertip - move the fingertip sensor away from the base of the fingertip (1cm away max) 7. Make the final knot - you need to make it very close to the finger nail hole (1-2cm away max) 7. Just use a screwdriver to make the thumb start closing. Just recall to do not force with the screwdriver if the movement looks like stuck, do some rotation clock/counter-clock wise in order to unstuck it. YOU ARE DONE!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!! Please close the fingertip and its nail and put back in place the lateral bar WATCH OUT FOR the Right forearm : the motor positions are \"mirrored\" respect to the Left ones. RING AND PINKIE: \u00b6 Note Those fingers need to be done together in order to make sure that both cables close simultaneously. WHERE step by step guide 1. Prepare 2 cables of about 40 cm of IITCODE 2391 and make sure you make the knot as taught above. !!!watch out!!! the 2 holes are a bit off one to another: make sure, with a fat screwdriver, that the pulley is NOT 180 degrees rotated or else the cables could jump one on another during the closing phase. 2. Insert both cables into their respective holes and start wiring as follow. 3. Push the 2 cables in the sheath until they get out from the 2 holes circled. 4. Cable routing. To be able to pass the cable at the base of the nail it is important to remove the nail and move forward the fingertip for 1 cm from its base. picture if possible 5. Please write with a marker at the base of the nails where the knot should be in order to have a perfect simultaneous closing for both fingers. 6. finally make the knot - - PLEASE DO NOT USE GLUE Tip The insertion of the cables into their holes, passing through the pulleys, is tricky. If you are struggling, cut the cable extremity with a 45 deg angle , so it will be easier for it to get in position. 3 Proximal Joints \u00b6 3.1 location \u00b6 LEFT FOREARM RIGHT FOREARM If you ever realize that one of the following cable is broken bear in mind: Tip The start of the wiring for each proximal is identical (wiring around the motor pulley). The index and middle proximal joints are cabled exactly the same way, just the thumb is a bit trickier. 3.2 WIRING \u00b6 3.2.1 Preparation \u00b6 The minimum requirement to start re-cabling the proximal joints is: IITCODE Alias Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel micro-cable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. diameter 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 3.2.2 Cabling the Motor Pulley \u00b6 LOCATION step by step guide Take 1 meter of IITCODE 1815. Turn the pulley in order to have the threads already facing (pointing toward) the holes inside the pink frame and the hole inside the pulley itself lying at horizontal. Insert the cable inside the pulley and equitably half the cable on both sides of the pulley. In order to differentiate the two cable parts, we will call them red and blue. !!!TIP!!! In order to keep in position the cable split in two halves, pull it like shown in the last pic Respect the only one rule: 2 full turns around the pulley for the hole close to the ball bearing (blue cable) and 1 full turn for the part that will go into the hole the closest from the motor (red cable). In order to keep the cable in position after the turns, you can push it with a screwdriver like shown in this last picture Tip YOU may need to glue the cable at the tip (2cm long) on both sides. With a plier make 2 times 90 degree angles on the cable at about 3-4mm from one another, in order to create a hook. Extract the cable once it passes between the thread and the neck of the frame. Tip When inserting the cable in the pulley, make sure that the pulley holes are in phase with the frame holes. In other words, the pulley threads need to be aligned with the 2 holes in the frame. LOCATION step by step guide !!!!WARNING!!! the cabling for the thumb passes first by a pair of pulleys before returning to a perfectly identical cabling as Index and Middle. After wrapping the cable on the pulley, insert the 2 cable extremities inside the frame holes. For the thumb, the frame holes are designed inclined by 45 deg. Push the 2 sides of the cable inside the sheath (+) and (-) for each finger. The 2 sides of the cables should get out: For the THUMB only: the cabling for the thumb passes first by a pair of pulleys before returning to a perfectly identical cabling as Index and Middle, as shown below. For all the proximal joints the final cabling starts at the base of their respective finger. Cable as follow and block each side of the cable with the nut screw M1.6x3 Tense each side of the cable by releasing the nut screw and pinch and rotate. Close the nut screw. Make a knot at the base of the cable exit, a little further away from it (\u00b15 mm) AND keep in mind that the knot will have to remain in the slot . FINISHED!!!

You should be able to make he cable jump around the STEP 2: You should be able to make the cable jump over the pulley STEP 3: Remove the central screw of this pulley RC_TLR_001_P_243 STEP 4: Use 2 fat flat screwdrivers to make the pulley popping up. -> photo needed D- create the require space pictures step by step guide In order to change the cable 11, it is necessary, when you still have the upper body attached to the robot to create some space in between those 2 pieces to be able to fit the cable that you need to replace. STEP 1: Remove the central piece which will hold the cable 11. 4 screws M2.5v5 STEP 2: Untighten just enough to have 2mm gap in between the head screw and the plate STEP 3: Untighten just enough to have 2mm gap in between the head screw and the plate STEP 4: You should be able to move slightly the upper body from the torso and create some space (2mm max - just the minimum required to pass the body of the cable in between the 2 pieces). 2.2 WAIST BACK - Cable 11 \u00b6 Warning routing cable 11 is quite simple in process of construction because you don't have yet the upper body mounted atop of the waist BUT become particularly tedious in phase of repair due to the presence of this latter. If you haven't removed the cover above the torso and the back (or backpack cover), please follow this link How to lock securedly the crimp: when you finalize your wiring it is important to realize that the tensioners are actually designed to prevent the crimp from escaping. As most of the cable inside the robot use the property of antagonism cabling it is important to have them both firmly tighten. Rule The crimp is always rotated upside down in order to prevent the crimp cable from popping out. The drawback of this positioning is that you always need to remove both tensioner and the screw to leave the crimp getting in the through and put back the tensioner above it to finalize the wiring. Procedure: Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place the cable onto the slot of the pulley (Photo 1). Put the squared plate above the cable and secure it with 4 screws with hexagonal head size M2.5x5 (Photo 2) Warning For people having the upper body still hanging CLOSE the gap Turn the cable around the pulley taking care to cross it at the opposite side of the plate (Photo 3 - 4). Each side of the cable go up and pass into the little side pulley (Photo 5 - 6) Tip Use a 2mm hexagonal screwdriver to spin the motor shaft (Photo N.9) - on both sides of iCub hips - allowing you to rotate the internal pulley (where yield the tensioners) and have it in a proper angle. To finish the wiring, position the head of the crimps inside their respective tensioners on both side of the inner part of the hips (Photo 7 - 8). Please use the rule for a proper locking of the crimp link To bring the joint a proper position to start correctly the routing of cable 12, please use the head screw inside the hips (Photo 9) simultaneously or one hip at a time by few degree every now and then. To arrive on the position (Photo 10) 2.3 WAIST FRONT \u2013 Cable 12 \u00b6 Procedure: Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place the cable into the slot of the pulley (Photo 12) Put the rectangular plate above the cable and secure it with 4 screws M2.5x5 hexagonal head (Photo 13). Turn the cable around the pulley taking care to cross the cable above the pulley (Photo 14). To finish the wiring, position the head of the crimps inside their respective tensioners on both side of the inner part of the hips (Photo 15 - 16). Please use the rule for a proper locking of the crimp link Finally, To put an end to the wiring of cable 11 and 12, just tense the 4 tensioners on which the crimps are located. Take care of tensing every one of them little by little in order to share the tension inside the tensioners in the same way. At this point, the cables of the wiring of the waist 11 and 12 is terminated and therefore it is possible to proceed with the positioning of the upper body above the latter. 2.4 WAIST TOP \u2013 Cable 13 \u00b6 Procedure: Take the cable and draw with a marker the middle of it. Place it in the slot on the piece RC_TLR_001_P_243 (Photo 18).Put the plate RC_USAL_001_P_219 on the cable and secure it with 4 screws M2.5x5 hexagonal head (Photo 19). Turn the cable around the RC_TLR_001_P_243 piece taking care to cross it around the pulley, the opposite side to the plate (Photo 20).Then pass the cable through the grooves of the pulleys RC_USAL_001_P_119 (Photo 21) To Finish the wiring, draw the cable along the pulley RC_USAL_001_P_124, and place the crimp in the appropriate tensioner RC_USAL_001_P_131 (Photo 22). Do the same for the other side of the cable and cross the cable before reaching the tensioner (Photo 23). 3 LEG CABLING \u00b6 This chapter describes the steps required both during construction and in maintenance phase to route of the cables 14 of the hip of the robot and cables 15 or 16 of the ankle present on robot with lower body version 1. 3.1 HIP FLEXION \u2013 Cable 14 \u00b6 Preparation: The cable has to be previously peeled off, at a distance of 435 mm from crimp, for a total of 50 mm. (see below) Tip the latter version of iCub have a cover, you may need to remove it before proceeding(see picture below). To do that remove the 2 screws of the cover. To unscrew them it is important to see them, use a hexagonal screw driver 2mm and turn the motor shaft from the other side of the motor(see picture below). Procedure: Take the cable and place the part stripped in the slot on the piece RC_IIT_001_P_314, then center and block it with the help of the plate RC_IIT_001_P_328 (Photo 24). The shortest part of the cable is the one going outside of the robot. Take the inner part of the cable (the right one so to speak \u2013 or the longest) and make one turn around the pulley RC_IIT_001_P_314 (Photo 25). If done correctly you should have the 2 crimps reunited down below the hip (photo N.26). At this point proceed route the cables by making an 8 shape, by crossing the cables and follow the wiring (photo N.28) (shortest part - yellow cable) and insert both crimp inside their respective tensioner - piece RC_USAL_001_P_131 (Photo 27). 4.1 ANKLE FLEXION - Cable 15 or Cable 16 \u00b6 Those 2 cables are only on some previous iCub design V1.

The internal (refer to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see the differences? YOU may have guessed on your own but the answer is only that the external one is beneath the 3 proximal motors which makes it more complicated to reach and repair; apart from that it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motor, if you need to repair the external wrist motor, and follow up with the explanation of the tendon in a more generical way, as both motors are wired in the same way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually beneath them. STEP 2: remove or loose the 2 screws M2.5x8 holding the motor. From now on you can work freely. STEP 3: remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner. !!!WARNING!!! once removed, either you put back the brand new cable inside or else just simply gather the part removed from the tensioner assembly and re-screw it back in until further notice in order to DO NOT LOSE PIECES!!! We can now start wiring!!! STEP 4: Let's begin with the motor pulley. Take a piece of uncoated cable (more or less 20 cm). Let its extremities be E1 and E2. Pass the cable trough the hole (H) in the pulley. Block the cable on the hole H with some cyanoacrylic glue. STEP 5: Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit pulleys: the cable should be tangential to the pulleys. Block the cable on the motor with some tape. This will allow you to maintain the cable positioned on the pulley. This wiring is identical for the cables E5-E6. STEP 6: Wrist pulley (E3-E7): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E3) and pass it trough the hole H3 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H4. STEP 7: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E7 is identical. STEP 8: Wrist pulley (E4-E8): take a piece of cable. Tie in a knot at one extremity. Take the other extremity (E4) and pass it trough the hole H1 on the pulley on the wrist side. Exit the pulley trough the hole H2. STEP 9: Wrap the cable as shown. The wiring of E8 is identical. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to re-wire every single cable of the wrist you need to insert the tensioners. STEP 10: Pass E3 through the tensioner (LHS1) and tie a knot (KN3). This knot should be positioned taking into account the length of the tensioner. Remove E1 from the tape that blocks it on the motor and pass it trough the tensioner (RHS1). Tie in a knot (KN1) on E1. This knot should be positioned so as to have the tensioner in the middle of the admissible range of movements. Repeat for cables E2 &E4. STEP 11: Tight the tensioners by screwing in the extremities. 1.2 Wrist passive tendons \u00b6 1.2.1 Location & identification \u00b6 From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the Right Wrist and Left Wrist building the passive part of the wrist movements. The pink cable is cable 9 and the red one is cable 10 . Left wrist Right wrist 1.2.2 Cabling \u00b6 Here the sequence you need to follow to restore the 2 little cables from the base of the wrist - we will write down the procedure using the left arm as base pictures but use the previous pictures above to mirror the explanations. Which is the length of each cable? (Need measurements in lab) pictures step by step procedure !!!KEEP IN MIND - whenever you need to replace one of the 2 cables you FIRST need to release the tensioners . Just put one side of the crimp of each cable inside its tensioner and follow the path until its blue stopper. The X (cross) in the pictures represents a knot at the end of the cable. Cable 9 needs to be inserted inside the hole H1, while cable 10 in the hole H2. To block the cable ends you first need to unscrew the stopper (red circles), then insert the cable and screw it back. Tie in a knot in order to prevent any cable slippage. Once done: tighten the screws of both tensioners until you reach a strict tensing on the cables. 2 HAND \u00b6 2.1 Location \u00b6 The Hand wiring consists of the Thumb Oppose and the Fingers Abduction. In the picture below you can see where the cables and their respective motors are located (Left hand palm down). The minimum requirement to start recabling those 2 joints is: IITCODE Alias Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel microcable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. dia 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 2.2 Thumb Oppose \u00b6 Here are the instructions for rewiring the Thumb Oppose Joint at the base of the Left Hand. pictures step by step guide STEP 1: The only way to start correctly this wiring is to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 inside the palm (circled in red) and the 2 at the base of the wrist M1.6x4 (blue). STEP 2: we will now focus on the wiring along the pulley. Cut ~ 40cm of cable. Move with a screwdriver the pulley in order to have the hole (red circle) flat horizontally. Insert the cable, equilibrate evenly the cable on both sides of the pulley. The cable exits are S0 and S2 (blue circles). STEP 3: Make 1 turn around the pulley CCW to go into S2 ball bearing side 2 turns around the pulley CW to reach S0 motor side. !!!TIP: You may find convenient to remove the plate to round the cable around the pulley more easily. STEP 4: Insert both side of the cable inside S2 and S0 until they sprout out from the palm side STEP 5: Insert the cables in the central pulley at the base of the thumb as shown. STEP 6: Use a 0.7mm hexagonal key (or screwdriver) to block the cables with the set screws. !!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE DONE!!! 2.3 Fingers Abduction \u00b6 Sheaths Length Label T1 38(mm) T0 T2 27(mm) T2 T3 38(mm) T3 T4 44(mm) T4 Here are the instructions for recabling the Fingers Abduction joint of the Left Hand. For the right one the procedure is mirrored. pictures step by step guide First we need to remove the hand dorsum: remove the screw M2x6 holding the dorsum cover and turn upside down the cover from the external part. Now it is necessary to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 inside the palm (circled in red) and the 2 at the base of the wrist M1.6x4 (blue). Once removed the palm, remove the overall 4 set screws. Use a 0.7mm hexagonal - screwdriver or key. Remove the overall remaining pieces of the broken cable before starting to restore it and inspect inside the cage. Remove every single board above the knuckles - the MAIS board (green) and the fingertips Hall sensors (white). In details: 1. Unplug every single chipset from the main board. !!!TIP: Please write down with a marker the initial of the finger chipset you unplug - it is sometimes messy when remounting everything to find out which chipset is for which finger 2. Remove the power connector 4. With caution please remove the MAIS Board (by removing its tape) - on the bottom side of the board there is an inductor that sometimes got broken when remove carelessly. Let's get to business and Let's start wiring! Let's start from the back of the hand. Take a piece of cable (more or less 40cm) and pass it trough the central hole in the pulley (red circle). Optionally you can block the cable on the pulley putting a drop of cyanoacrylic glue into the hole. Twine the cable on the pulley. The number of turns around the pulley has to be decided on the basis of the entrance and exit holes: the cable should enter the holes tangentially. Thus, insert the cable extremities, into the two holes H1 and H2 (red circles). Pass one cable extremity trough the sheath T1 and the other one trough T2. Position the extremities of the sheaths on the sockets of the 2 exit holes in the motor support. Note: the sheath extremity should be inserted correctly in its socket. Focusing on the side of the cable inserted in the sheath T1, pass it through the tensioner and insert the sheath extremity in the tensioner socket. Then, continue the path inserting the cable through the sheath T3 until reaching a hole H3 in the hand frame (blue circle). Finally, insert the cable in the hole and position the extremity of T3 on the socket in correspondence of the hole. Twine the cable around the pulley at the base of the index finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H7 and exit from H8. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S9. Tie a knot about 1 cm away from the pulley. Going back to the other cable extremity inserted in the sheath T2, position the extremity of T2 on the socket in correspondence of the hole H4. Finally, insert the cable in the hole. Twine the cable around the pulley at the base of the pinkie finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H9 and exit from H10. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S10. Twine the cable around the little pulley and then around the pulley at the base of the ring finger. Pass the cable ending trough the hole H11 and exit from H12. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S11. Pass the cable trough the hole H5 and the sheath T4. Position the extremity of the sheath on the socket of H5. Note: the tube extremity should be inserted correctly in its socket. Pass the cable trough the hole H6 and position the extremity of T4 on the socket of H6. At this point we close the loop, reaching again the first pulley located at the base of the index. Twine the cable around the pulley and pass the cable ending trough the hole H13 and exit from H14. Block the cable on the pulley with the screw S12. Tie a knot about 1cm away from the pulley. Now unscrew all the screws blocking the cable on the pulleys (S9, S10, S11 and S12). Note that this operation can be done only at a specific configuration of the fingers. At this configuration the screws are accessible thanks to suitable holes on the palm. In the picture you can see the final cable configuration on the first pulley at the base of the Index. The 2 parts of the cabled are represented by different colors. Now tension the cable: 1) Pull the blue cable from its ending. Check that the sheath is inside its sockets at H1 and H3 and block the cable extremity with the screw S9. 2) Pull the red cable from its ending. Check that the sheath is inside its sockets at H4, H5 and H6. Block the cable with the screw S10, S11 and S12. Final test: Use the head screw from the pulley motor to check if the fingers get opened-closed whenever you turn it CW or CCW. !!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE DONE!!! Use every unmounting step to put back in place every part of the hand. Tip Tensioning the cable is very important. Even when all the screws are not tight, it may result difficult to tension the cable in all of its parts. This is due to the sharp edges of the pulley which do not allow a uniform distribution of the tension. Tip For the Fingers Abduction always start from the index as previously shown. Tip Each pulley at the base at the fingers has a Pin . If passing trough the holes is complicated, you can remove the finger from the palm. After this operation the pulley can be made more accessible by rotating it around its Pin. In the picture below you can see the pin of the Index pulley.","title":"Wrist and Hand Cabling V1"},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V1/#1-wrist","text":"","title":"1 WRIST"},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V1/#11-wrist-motor-tendons","text":"","title":"1.1 Wrist motor tendons"},{"location":"icub_tendons/wrist_hand_cabling_V1/#111-location-identification","text":"From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the tendons inside the Right Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons.

Focusing on the side of the cable inserted in the sheath T1, pass it through the tensioner and insert the sheath extremity in the tensioner socket. Then, continue the path inserting the cable through the sheath T3 until reaching a hole H3 in the hand frame (blue circle). Finally, insert the cable in the hole and position the extremity of T3 on the socket in correspondence of the hole. Twine the cable around the pulley at the base of the index finger.

From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 8 tendons inside the Left Forearm building the active part of the wrist tendons. 1.2.2 Cabling \u00b6 In the case you found out 1 of the 8 first cables of the wrist broken, here is the sequence you need to follow to restore it. Pictures step by step guide FIRST THING FIRST: Which side of the wrist is broken? The internal (refers to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see some visual differences? YOU may have guessed on your own, but the answer is only that the external motor is beneath the 3 proximal motors, which makes it more complicated to reach and repair. Apart from that, it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motors and follow up with the explanation of the tendon repair in a more generical way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: Remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually the motor beneath them. STEP 2: Remove the 2 screws M2.5x10 holding the motor. From now on, you can work freely. STEP 3: Remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner. !!!WARNING!!! It is the utmost importance that you DO NOT MIX the 3 parts of the tensioner. ALWAYS KEEP THEM TOGETHER the main part and its 2 screwing side STEP 4: At the level of the wrist pulley, just remove the broken cable and replace it : EASY for cable 5 and 6 BUT LESS EASY for cable 1 and 2, because you need to remove the mechanical part preventing you from inserting and removing the head crimp. To do so, just remove the 2 screws M2x6 and slide the block to retrieve and replace the head crimp. Once done, put back on place the block and the 2 screws. We can now start wiring!!! STEP 5: Let's begin with the motor pulley, here is the way to wire them both (as they are perfectly identical). LEFT ARM The BLUE cables for the Left Forearm are: 4 and 7 The RED cables for the Left Forearm are: 3 and 8 RIGHT ARM The BLUE cables for the Right Forearm are: 3 and 8 The RED cables for the Right Forearm are: 4 and 7 STEP 6: Put a 2 tie wraps one for each side (or cable) in order to prevent them from getting untwisted. picture motor almost closed on support STEP 7: Put back in place the motor with its 2 screws M2.5x10. Leave 1mm in between the motor and the support. We will cover this aspect later. STEP 8: Let's wire the wrist pulleys (either for 1,2 or 5,6) Here is the detailed wiring for the left arm, please mirror it for the right arm. The wiring is quite simple. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to rewire every single one of the wrist cables you need to insert the tensioners. Let's make the example of the 4 cables 1 to 4. STEP 9: Remove the tie wrap at the level of the motor wrist, for let's say cable 3. Open one side of the tensioner and start putting the ring, then the threaded piece of the tensioner, finish by screwing the ring onto the threaded piece. Do the exact same for the cable 1. STEP 10: Screw both pieces into the main tensioner part - Let's say just 2 threads on both sides, just to make it hold until we tense it. STEP 11: Repeat STEP 9 and STEP 10 with cables 2 and 4. STEP 12: Use 2 pliers to hold on the tips of the threaded pieces' tensioner and use with any tool fitting the hole inside the main part of the tensioner AND finally screw them. !!! TIP !!! depending on how you are facing the cables just screw CW or CCW for half a turn to understand if the 2 threaded pieces are going inside the main piece or if they get out - THEY NEED TO GET IN OBVIOUSLY. Repeat the above step on both tensioners until you get a quite nice tensing (but not super tense, this will be done right next). FINAL STEP: Tense the 2 screws that we left a bit opened on STEP 7. 1.3 WRIST - PASSIVE TENDONS \u00b6 1.3.1 Location and Identification \u00b6 From the pictures below you will be able to locate and identify the 2 tendons inside both the Right Wrist and Left Wrist building the passive part of the wrist movements.

CABLE 10: it is really straight forward - just put one side of the crimp of cable 10 inside the tensioner (blue circle) and put the other side inside the holding tooth. CABLE 9: it is just a bit more complicated because you need to first remove the screw to be able to lodge the crimp inside the tensioner and put back in place the tensioner in the throat and insert the screw. Once done: tighten the screws of both tensioners until you reach a strict tensing on the cables. 2 HAND \u00b6 2.1 Location \u00b6 The minimum requirement to start re-cabling those 2 joints is: IITCODE Alias Description 1815 CG077063 Stainless steel micro-cable, cable construction 7x7mm, nom. diameter 0,63mm, not coated, AISI 316 2.2 THUMB OPPOSE \u00b6 As usual, you will find here after the instructions for rewiring the Thump oppose joint at base of the Left Hand.

Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 (circled in red) inside the palm and the 2 screws M2x4 (circled in blue) at the base of the wrist. STEP 2 : We will now focus on the wiring along the pulley. Cut 50 to 60cm of ITTCODE 1815. Move with a screwdriver the pulley in order to have the hole flat horizontally. Insert the cable, divide equally the cable from part to part of the pulley. STEP 3: DO 1 turn around the pulley CCW to go into S2 ball-bearing side 2 turns around the pulley CW to reach S0 motor side !!!TIP: You may find convenient to remove the plate to round the cable around the pulley more easily. STEP 4: Insert both sides of the cable inside S2 and S0 until they sprout out from the palm side. Remember that S0 is the shorter sheath and S2 is the longer one. BE CAREFUL! The right hand is not symmetrical. !!!!TIP: once both sides of the cables are out at the base of the palm, you may find convenient to verify the turns around the pulley ( you could use 2 pieces of foam hear plugs to prevent the cable from unwired itself) - Make sure the plate is screwed back into normal state. STEP 5: The cable from S0 goes directly into hole T1. The cable from S2 makes 1 FULL TURN around the pulley before going into T2. STEP 6: Use a 0.7mm hexagonal key (or screwdriver) to block the cables. !!!TIP: you may find useful to first block one side and afterwards use a plier to exert a strong pulling of the wire to tense this other side of the cable and block it. Repeat the the same process on the other side. FINAL CHECK: If the cabling is correct, when rotating the motor CW the finger should open (hand wide open) !!!!CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE DONE!!! 2.3 FINGERS ABDUCTION \u00b6 PREFACE: This cable is THE most complicated to replace - rewire, mainly because you need to unmount a lot of parts BUT on the other hand it is also the most reliable - You may never need to replace it. Pictures step by step guide STEP 1: remove the screw M2x6 holding the dorsum cover and turn upside down the cover from the external part. The dorsum cover should get removed. STEP 2: The only way to start correctly this wiring is to remove the palm. Please remove the 3 screws M2x6 inside the palm (circled in red) and the 2 screws M2x4 (circled in blue) at base of the wrist. STEP 3: remove the overall set screws. Use a 0.7mm hexagonal - screwdriver or key. STEP 4: remove the overall remaining pieces of the broken cable before starting to restore it. Inspect inside the cage - remove the 2 screws M1.6x5. Let's get to business and Let's start wiring! STEP 5: start wiring: 2 Full Turns (blue) CCW around the pulley and it gets out into tube T2 1 Full Turn (red) CW around the pulley and it gets out into tube T0. !!!TIP!!! It could be a good idea to block the wiring around the pulley thx to some foam earplug or some paper. Here is a picture of the overall path of the cable inside the 3 tubes constituting the path of the cable. STEP 6: remove every single board above the knuckle. STEP 6a: remove the screw and flip over the board with the little chipsets. STEP 6b: 1. Unplug every single chipset from the main board !!!TIP: Please write down with a marker the initial of the finger chipset you unplug - it sometimes a bit messy when remounting everything to find out which chipset is for which finger. 2. remove the power connector 3. remove the 3 screws (2 M1x5 and 1 M1.6x6) 4. With caution please remove the MAIS Board - on the bottom side of the board there is an inductor that sometimes got broken when removed carelessly. STEP 6c: remove the 2 screws M1.6x6 Let's start with wiring the cable from T2 STEP 7: Here is the picture of the routing of the cable you need to realize. To do that, it is necessary to allow the pulleys to rotate around their pin. STEP 7a: PINKIE FINGER 1. you need to untighten ENTIRELY the axes screws on both sides of the finger (on the palm side it can be removed - pay attention that the ball bearing may fall as well, just remember to replace it when remounting - BUT REFRAIN TO REMOVE on top side - or else you will lose the center of the finger) 2. try to move the pulley along its pin until you succeed to insert the cable into it. 3. Put back on the axes screws and retighten them. STEP 7b: RING FINGER Same 3 first steps as the Pinkie finger. 4. Finally insert the cable into the hole leading to T4. STEP 8: Before starting to wire the base of the index finger it is really important to block the cable at the base of the pinkie finger - in this way we wont unintentionally untwine the wiring at the level of the motor pulley. 1. Insert the set-screw onto the pinkie finger and tighten it.. Let's start wiring the index base pulley STEP 9: As for pinkie and ring fingers: 1. untighten the 2 axes screws in order to be able to move the pink (color) pulley sideways around its PIN 2. Pass the cable coming from T4 (red) inside the pulley hole. STEP 10: 1. wire the cable from T0 (blue) 2. re-center the pinky pulley 3. put the axes screw back on. Let's start tensing the cable STEP 11: 1. take one plier - pinch at the exit of the cable from the pinky pulley and twist it to retrieve the excess of cable which will have for consequence to tense this part of the cable - the overall fingers should get closer to each other 2. put the set-screw A and B 3. Tense the other side of the cable (blue part) the same way 4. put the set-screw C STEP 12: Final test: 1. remove the 2 blocks (foam ear plug or paper jamming) from the pulley motor 2. use the head screw from the pulley motor to check if the fingers get opened-closed whenever you turn it CW or CCW.

Pictures step by step guide FIRST THING FIRST: Which side of the wrist is broken? The internal (refers to cables 1 to 4) or the external one (refers to cables 5 to 8)? Can you see some visual differences? YOU may have guessed on your own, but the answer is only that the external motor is beneath the 3 proximal motors, which makes it more complicated to reach and repair. Apart from that, it is exactly identical - so to proceed we will first see how to move the proximal motors and follow up with the explanation of the tendon repair in a more generical way. If you need to repair tendons from 1 to 4 please just proceed to STEP 2 STEP 1: Remove the 6 screws M1.6x5 and flip over the 3 motors to be able to access visually the motor beneath them. STEP 2: Remove the 2 screws M2.5x10 holding the motor. From now on, you can work freely. STEP 3: Remove the broken part of the cable still inside the tensioner. !!!WARNING!!! It is the utmost importance that you DO NOT MIX the 3 parts of the tensioner. ALWAYS KEEP THEM TOGETHER the main part and its 2 screwing side STEP 4: At the level of the wrist pulley, just remove the broken cable and replace it : EASY for cable 5 and 6 BUT LESS EASY for cable 1 and 2, because you need to remove the mechanical part preventing you from inserting and removing the head crimp. To do so, just remove the 2 screws M2x6 and slide the block to retrieve and replace the head crimp. Once done, put back on place the block and the 2 screws. We can now start wiring!!! STEP 5: Let's begin with the motor pulley, here is the way to wire them both (as they are perfectly identical). LEFT ARM The BLUE cables for the Left Forearm are: 4 and 7 The RED cables for the Left Forearm are: 3 and 8 RIGHT ARM The BLUE cables for the Right Forearm are: 3 and 8 The RED cables for the Right Forearm are: 4 and 7 STEP 6: Put a 2 tie wraps one for each side (or cable) in order to prevent them from getting untwisted. picture motor almost closed on support STEP 7: Put back in place the motor with its 2 screws M2.5x10. Leave 1mm in between the motor and the support. We will cover this aspect later. STEP 8: Let's wire the wrist pulleys (either for 1,2 or 5,6) Here is the detailed wiring for the left arm, please mirror it for the right arm. The wiring is quite simple. We are finally getting to an end. Now that you know how to rewire every single one of the wrist cables you need to insert the tensioners. Let's make the example of the 4 cables 1 to 4. STEP 9: Remove the tie wrap at the level of the motor wrist, for let's say cable 3. Open one side of the tensioner and start putting the ring, then the threaded piece of the tensioner, finish by screwing the ring onto the threaded piece. Do the exact same for the cable 1. STEP 10: Screw both pieces into the main tensioner part - Let's say just 2 threads on both sides, just to make it hold until we tense it. STEP 11: Repeat STEP 9 and STEP 10 with cables 2 and 4. STEP 12: Use 2 pliers to hold on the tips of the threaded pieces' tensioner and use with any tool fitting the hole inside the main part of the tensioner AND finally screw them. !!! TIP !!! depending on how you are facing the cables just screw CW or CCW for half a turn to understand if the 2 threaded pieces are going inside the main piece or if they get out - THEY NEED TO GET IN OBVIOUSLY. Repeat the above step on both tensioners until you get a quite nice tensing (but not super tense, this will be done right next).

The majority of the base iCub software is written in the C++ programming language . As of 2020, the most common way of consuming the iCub software is by compiling it from source code. There are two possible methods to compile the iCub software from source code. The first one ( \"superbuild\" ) is to install the software via the robotology-superbuild , a distribution of software mantained at IIT and other related software. The second one ( \"manual\" ) is to manually install each software package required for iCub software on its own. The recommended way to consume iCub software for users that are not part of the iCub development is to stick to released versions of the iCub software, in particular to the distributions of software released every three months, as described in Software Distros . Documentation for compiling the iCub software from source are available in the Installation from sources menu section. Depending on the operating system you want to use, it may be available also the possibilities of installing the iCub software via pre-compiled binaries instead of manually compiling the source code. Documentation for this workflow is available in the Installation from pre-compiled binaries menu section. Regardless of how you installed your software, you can check if it has been installed correctly by following the instructions in the Check your installation page.

The make command in this case will download, compile and install all the software necessary to run the robot itself. If you need to use other superbuild profiles , they can be easily enabled with the corresponding CMake option. Important: do not run make install for the superbuild: the superbuild already installs all the software in /usr/local/src/robot/robotology-superbuild/build/install , and installing the software elsewhere on the robot is not currently supported. Important: If you are using an old iCub that still uses the CAN internal bus, you also need to enable the ROBOTOLOGY_USES_CFW2CAN CMake option.

The make command in this case will download, compile and install all the software necessary to run the robot itself. If you need to use other superbuild profiles , they can be easily enabled with the corresponding CMake option. Important: do not run make install for the superbuild: the superbuild already installs all the software in /usr/local/src/robot/robotology-superbuild/build/install , and installing the software elsewhere on the robot is not currently supported. Important: If you are using an old iCub that still uses the CAN internal bus, you also need to enable the ROBOTOLOGY_USES_CFW2CAN CMake option. Note that in this case the .bashrc_iCub file should also contain the definition of the CFW2CANAPI_DIR environmental variables, in addition to all the environmental variable already defined in that file.

This largely caused the skin patch PCB to flex and break, because the patches took the high curvature of the cover (see image). - To solve this problem, we reduced the number of PCBs by arranging a strip with 5 PCBs (skin patch) on the flat surface of the cover. (see image) - Assembly instruction. \u00b6 First of all, it must be said that the electronic part of the upper arm covers is already supplied, that is, the MTB4 cards and the hexagon shape (skin) are mounted, glued and connected together. Before starting assembly, check the orientation of the covers. - Assembly sequence : Perform the assembly sequence as shown in the image, keep in mind that the sequence is the same for both upper arms (Right and left) First step push the cover (RC_IIT_017_P_023) inwards so as to align the attachment holes, both positions (TOP and BOTTOM), as can be seen in the image. - Second and third step, fix the cover using the respective screws as shown in the image. This applies to both positions TOP and BOTTOM. - Fourth step, close the covers of the upper arm by pushing the Lover cover inwards in order to align the attachment holes.

This largely caused the skin patch PCB to flex and break, because the patches took the high curvature of the cover (see image). - To solve this problem, we reduced the number of PCBs by arranging a strip with 5 PCBs (skin patch) on the flat surface of the cover.

Before starting assembly, check the orientation of the covers. - Assembly sequence : Perform the assembly sequence as shown in the image, keep in mind that the sequence is the same for both upper arms (Right and left) First step push the cover (RC_IIT_017_P_023) inwards so as to align the attachment holes, both positions (TOP and BOTTOM), as can be seen in the image. - Second and third step, fix the cover using the respective screws as shown in the image. This applies to both positions TOP and BOTTOM. - Fourth step, close the covers of the upper arm by pushing the Lover cover inwards in order to align the attachment holes. After that fix the covers with the respective lives as shown in the pictures. This applies to both positions TOP and BOTTOM. - -","title":"Assembly instruction."}]}
